00 03 37 58 CC
Roger. Could you give us comments on how the transposition and docking went? Over.

00 03 38 07 CMP
I thought it went pretty well, Houston, although I expect I used more gas than I've been using in the simulator. The turnaround maneuver - I went PITCH ACEL COMMAND and started to pitch up, and then when I put MANUAL, ATTITUDE PITCH back to RATE COMMAND for some reason it - it stopped its pitch rate, and I had to go back to ACCEL COMMAND and hit what I thought was an extra PROCEED on the DSKY. During the course of that, we drifted slightly further away from the S IVB than I expected. I expected to be out about 66 feet. My guess would be I was around 100 or so; and therefore, I expect I used a bit more coming back in. But, except for using a little more gas - And I'd be interested in your numbers on that - everything went nominally.

00 03 38 53 CC
This is Houston. Roger. We copy.

00 03 43 45 CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.

Roger. We're working on the pressurization of the LM now, and working off the decal with CSM-LM pressure equalization. And we're down to step 13, where we're waiting for the cabin pressure to be 5, or it should be roughly 5, before we turn the REPRESS package O2 valve to FILL. Instead of 5, we're running about 4.4. Over.

00 03 44 16 CC
Roger. Stand by a second.

00 03 44 55 CMP
And Houston, Apollo 11. We did put the REPRESS package O2 valve to FILL momentarily there at step 13, and we have filled the bottles back up partially. What's the pressure reading in there, Neil?

00 03 45 17 CMP
We have about 450 psi now in the three 1-pound bottles.

00 03 45 23 CC
Roger. Stand by a second, please.

00 03 45 25 CMP
Roger. Standing by. The REPRESS package valve is now in the OFF position. What's the cabin pressure now, Buzz? Cabin pressure is now 4.5.

00 03 47 49 CDR
Houston, Apollo 11. We think these readings are within normal tolerances. We just wanted to get your concurrence before we press down any further with these decals.

Roger. LM looks to be in pretty fine shape from about all we can see from here.

00 03 48 43 CC
Okay. In reference to your question on this step 13 on the decal, I understand that you have used up the contents of the REPRESS O2 package and at that time, instead of being up to 5 psi, you were reading 4.4. Is that correct?

00 03 49 07 CMP
Okay. 4.4. Yes sir.

00 03 49 11 CC
Okay. And you want to know if you can go ahead and use additional oxygen to bring the command module up to 5.0 and continue the equalization? Over.

00 03 49 37 CMP
Okay. We're pressing on with the procedure.

00 03 49 40 CC
And 11, Houston. We have a request for you. On the service module secondary propellant fuel pressurization valve: As a precautionary measure, we'd like you to momentarily cycle the four switches to the CLOSE position and then release. As you know, we have no TM or talkback on these valve positions, and it's conceivable that one of them might also have been moved into a different position by the shock of separation. Over.

Okay. Good idea. That's being done.

Well, we didn't have much time, Houston, to talk to you about our views out the window when we were preparing for LM ejection; but up to that time, we had the entire northern part of the lighted hemisphere visible including North America, North Atlantic, and Europe and Northern Africa. We could see that the weather was good all - just about everywhere. There was one cyclonic depression in Northern Canada, in the Athabaska - probably east of Athabaska area. Greenland was clear, and it appeared to be we were seeing just the icecap in Greenland. All North Atlantic was pretty good; and Europe and Northern Africa seemed to be clear. Most of the United States was clear. There was a low - looked like a front stretching from the center of the country up across north of the Great Lakes and into Newfoundland.

Okay. I guess the view must be pretty good from up there. We show you just roughly somewhere around 19,000 miles out now.

Houston, Apollo 11. We've completed our maneuver to, observe the slingshot attitude, but we don't see anything - no Earth and no S IVB.

00 04 57 48 CC
Roger. Stand by. In GET I have a LOX dump start time for you. It's supposed to start at 5 plus 03 plus 07, and stop at 5 plus 04 plus 55. Ullage burn starts at 5 plus 37 plus 47, stops at 5 plus 42 plus 27. Over.

Roger. We now recommend the following attitude: roll 307.0, pitch 354.0, yaw 019.5, and the LOX dump has already been enabled, so we can't hold it off any longer.

00 05 01 14 CMP
That's okay. Go ahead. We'll maneuver around to 307, 354, and 19 and a half. Thank you sir.

00 05 01 54 CMP
Okay, Houston. You got to us just a little late. Our maneuver's already begun, so it's going to cost us about the same amount of fuel to stop it, no matter where we stop it, and we may as well keep going.

be coming out of two radially opposite directions from the S IVB.

00 05 13 51 CC
Roger. They're continuing with the nonpropulsion vent from the liquid oxygen tank. It would be radially opposite, then. And boosters tell me it's the continuous vent system. They're also dumping a small amount of fuel at this time. We've got about 23-1/2 minutes or so until the APS burn. Over.

Sure, be glad to. I can go back and do the whole thing and pick different stars.

00 05 41 52 CC
I don't think there - there's any need to do that. We'd just like to confirm it with a different star, since that roll angle was a little larger than we expected.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We recommend you accept the NOUN 49 display on the DSKY now. Over.

Okay. It looks like an awful big one. We noticed that you'd moved star number 2 to the



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 5/3 Page 36

tail end of the listing, and we should be marking first on star 40. Did that have anything to do with it?

00 06 40 47 CC
Negative. We don't believe so, Apollo 11. We think that this is possibly due to some TLI dispersions, and it's probably satisfactory. So go ahead and accept this. It fits our criteria anyway that if you repeat the mark and you get an equivalent size to go ahead and accept it. And this is an equivalent size error. Over.

And, Houston, Apollo 11. These AUTO optics maneuvers or P23's, AUTO maneuvers, don't seem to be going to the substellar point. Can you come up with the roll, pitch, and yaw angle for the substellar point on this star? It's our second star.

Charlie, state those three angles one more time. I'd like to confirm them before I maneuver.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to go on to star 45. Over.

00 07 33 53 CMP
Okay.

00 07 33 54 CC
And, Mike, we think these large DELTA-R's, NOUN 49, you're getting is really meaningful since it's been way before TLI since we had a state vector update; and we think it's normal. Over.

00 07 34 09 CMP
Okay. Could be, Charlie. Some of the early markings, I might not have had precisely the substellar point. I think as time goes by they've been coming more accurate but old Enif here is just flat invisible.

00 07 34 21 CC
Roger.

00 07 34 49 CMP
And, Houston, Apollo 11. Understand that the same three gimbal angles you gave me should be valid for star 45 as well. Is that affirmative?

00 07 34 58 CC
I'm believe that's right. Stand by one. Over.

00 07 35 00 CMP
Okay.

00 07 35 03 CC
That is negative. Stand by one.

00 07 35 04 CMP

00 07 35 58 CMP
Okay. Just as a matter of comparison, P23 for this star would like to go to 235.66, 154.31, and 31365. Over.

00 07 36 15 CC
Roger. We copy, 11. We understand that the program can give you almost an infinite combination of angles in P23, and it's not too unreasonable. If you'll stand by, we'll look at these that we see on the DSKY. Over.

Okay, Charlie. If the attitude you gave me on star number 45 - The reticle is off, I'd say, a good 30 degrees in roll, and the star is not in sight. Over.

00 07 43 44 CC
Roger. Stand by.

00 07 43 47 CMP
I think something's wrong with those attitudes.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. I wondered if you have AUTO optics selected. Over.

00 07 45 21 CMP
That's affirmative.

00 07 45 26 CC
Roger. Looks like to us we need a PROCEED, Mike, to get the sextant pointed at the star. Over.

00 07 45 35 CMP
Okay. Stand by.

00 07 46 30 CC
11, Houston. Those shaft and trunnion angles were exactly what we were computing on the ground. Over.

00 07 46 45 CMP
Okay. I'm going to trim up the attitude here and give it another try.

00 07 47 55 CMP
Okay. I have this star loud and clear now, Charlie, so I might as well do a bunch of marks on this one to get a good horizon count.

00 07 48 03 CC
Roger. Stand by.

00 07 48 10 CMP
It still looks like I'm far from the substellar point. However, I'm off quite a hit in roll.

00 07 48 18 CC
Roger. We'd like you to mark right where it is now, Mike, and we'd like two sets of marks on this. Over.

00 07 48 28 CMP
Okay. Fine. But the reticle is not parallel to the horizon. I'd have to move off quite a hit in order to get it parallel to that.

00 07 48 40 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Our procedures guys are saying that the reticle does not have to be parallel. Over.

00 07 48 51 CMP
Well, then we're not at the substellar point if we're not.

00 07 48 54 CC
Roger.

00 07 51 39 CMP
Houston, you copy that NOUN 49?

00 07 51 41 CC
Roger. We see it, 11. Stand by.

00 07 52 09 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We would like you to accept this one and every mark thereafter. Over.

00 07 52 16 CMP
Okay.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 6/2 Page 42

00 07 52 55 CMP
Do you need me to wait in the NOUN 49 display for any length of time?

00 07 53 01 CC
Negative.

00 07 53 01 CMP
Okay.

00 07 54 29 CMP
Okay, Charlie. I'll be glad to give you as many of these as you like.

00 07 54 34 CC
Roger. We'd like six marks on star 45, Mike, and then we'll probably go back to star 2 again. Stand by. We'll have further word on that.

00 07 54 43 CMP
Okay.

00 07 55 20 CMP
They seem to be getting smaller, Charlie. Are you sure you wouldn't like some more?

00 07 55 23 CC
Stand by, Mike.

00 07 55 28 CMP
It's no trouble.

00 07 55 31 CC
Roger. Stand by. Out.

00 07 56 07 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to do two more on star 45. Over.

00 07 56 14 CMP
Okay.

00 07 58 02 CMP
Okay, Charlie. There's your two more marks. Where do you want to go from here?

00 07 58 06 CC
Stand by.

00 07 58 21 CC
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to go back to star number 2 with an attitude as follows: roll 1952, pitch 1239, yaw 3400. Mike, that'll give you a trunnion angle of about 31.4. Over.

00 07 58 45 CMP
Okay. I understand star number 2 and roll 195.2, itch 123.9, and yaw 340.0. Over.

00 07 58 57 CC
That's affirmative.

00 07 59 01 CMP
Okay.

00 08 02 07 CMP
Okay, Charlie. I'm there, and I've got a trunnion angle of 30.5 degrees. Again, misaligned considerably in roll and I do believe that's important to getting good marks.

00 08 02 20 CC
Stand by.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 6/3 Page 43

00 08 02 40 CMP
See, if my reticle's not parallel, then I'm not marking normal to the horizon and I'm not marking at the substellar point. I'm marking off somewhere else.

00 08 02 50 CC
Stand by one. Over.

00 08 02 52 CMP
Okay.

00 08 03 24 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. The ground-computed values for your shaft and trunnion are just what you're getting on the DSKY there, Mike. The horizon looks cocked off to you - You look like you're off in roll because the angles that we gave you to maneuver to, to prevent LM reflection from fouling up your optics, we feel like a - You should go ahead and mark on the stars just as is. Over.

00 08 03 53 CMP
Okay.

I'll bet you a cup of coffee on it.

Okay.

00 08 08 25 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We see your termination on P23. Thank you very much. Mike, we'll have a - We're trying to work up a story here for you; we'll be with you momentarily on an explanation of what' s happening. 0ver.

00 08 08 38 CMP
Okay, Charlie. It just appears to me that you have to have a reticle tangent to the horizon at the point at which you mark or else you're not at the substellar point; you're off laterally, and therefore you're measuring a larger trunnion angle than you should.

00 08 08 56 CC
Seems so to me. Our procedures people are working on this, and we'll be back with you momentarily. Over.

00 08 09 03 CMP
Thank you, sir.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Do you read? Over.

00 09 18 11 CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. If you read, this attitude 000 is pretty bad for our COMM. In fact, we've lost all data with you, and unreadable on the voice. We recommend you do the P52, option 1 preferred ...

00 09 18 25 CMP
... not a very good attitude at all for COMM, and as soon as we finish our alignment, we'll maneuver it to a different attitude. Over.

00 09 18 34 CC
Roger, 11. We copy. Recommend you go to this P52, option 1 preferred, and then go to PTC attitude. Over. Then we'll get some COMM. When you get there to PTC attitude, it'll be pitch 90, yaw 0 on the high gain. Over.

Roger, 11. That was a good readback. That was the block data scheduled for 12 hours. We'd like to just say that on a flight plan update here, just to remind you of some things, and you can do them at your convenience amd then go to sleep early if you'd like. We don't have anything else planned, but we'd like to just remind you on the filter change, the O2 fuel cell purge. And we'd like a LM/CM DELTA-P and accomplish the presleep checklist.

00 11 02 34 CDR
Okay. We've completed the filter change, and we'll get started on the fuel cell purge, and stand by for the LM/CM DELTA-P.

00 11 06 21 CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've been noting some funnies on the O2 flow indicator transducer. We've kind of got a suspicion that the transducer - We expected to see an O2 flow pegged high with the waste stowage vent to VENT. It was not. We also noted some funny indications when you closed the waste stowage vent valve. We're going to continue to take a look at this through the night, and we'll be with you in the morning with an assessment of the problem. Also, we'd like to ask specifically, when you place the waste stowage vent valve to VENT, does the detent - correction - Does the arrow line up with the detent? Over.

00 11 07 18 CMP
Stand by one, Charlie. We'll give you something on the detent.

00 11 07 28 CMP
Right now it's at CLOSED, and I lined up with CLOSED before I was at VENT; and best I can recall, it was quite accurately lined up with VENT. Would you like me to go to VENT again momentarily and see where it lines up?

00 11 18 45 CDR
Yes. Mike's got a couple of comments cn that.

00 11 18 49 CMP
It's working good so far, Charlie. We've got one installed on the water gun and the other one installed on the spigot down in the LEB, and we - mention one problem with them is that they leak at the junction between the food bag and the water filter. However, with that exception, they seem to be working pretty good. We were getting some gas through initially, and I think that was just getting the system purged out to begin with; and the last tubeful we poured was almost free of bubbles. Over.

00 11 19 31 CC
Roger. Sounds good. We'll check in on that problem with the SPAN guys and let you know in the morning. If you have to call us tonight, we'd like you to do it on DOWNVOICE BACKUP. We're configuring the MSFN for that mode; and as far as we can see, you're cleared for some z's. Over.

Okay. From Jodrell Bank, England, via AP: Britain's big Jodrell Bank radio telescope stopped receiving signals from the Soviet Union's unmanned Moon shot at 5:49 EDT today. A spokesman said that it appeared the Luna 15 space ship "had gone beyond the Moon." Another Quote: "We don't think it has landed," said a spokesman for Sir Bernard Lovell, Director of the Observatory. Washington UPI: Vice President Spiro T. Agnew has called for putting a man on Mars by the year 2000, but Democratic leaders replied that priority must go to needs on Earth. Agnew, ranking government official at the Apollo 11 blastoff Wednesday, apparently was speaking for himself and not necessarily for the Nixon administration when he said, "We should, in my judgment, put a man on Mars by the end of this century." Laredo, Texas, AP: Immigration officials in Nuevo Laredo announced Wednesday that hippies will be refused tourist cards to enter Mexico unless they take a bath and get haircuts. Huberto Cazaras, Chief of Mexican Immigration in Nuevo Laredo, said authorities in Mexico City, Acapulco, and other popular tourist spots have registered complaints about the hippies. By United Press International: Initial reaction to President Nixon's granting of a holiday Monday to Federal employees so they can observe a national day of participation in the Apollo 11 Moon landing mission mostly was one of surprise. Rodney Bidner, Associated Press, London AP: Europe is Moon struck by the Apollo 11 mission. Newspapers throughout the continent fill their pages with pictures of the Saturn V rocket blasting off to forge Earth's first link with its natural satellite. And the headline writers taxed their imagination for words to hail the feat. "The greatest adventure in the history of humanity has started," declared the French newspaper Le Figaro, which devoted four pages to reports from Cape Kennedy and diagrams of the mission. The tabloid Paris Jour proclaimed, "The whole word tells them bravo." The Communists daily L'Humanite led with the launch picture and devoted its entire back page to an enthusiastic Moon report describing the countdown and launch, the astronauts' wives and families, and backgrounding lunar activities.

Hempstead, New York: Joe Namath officially reported to the New York Jets training camp at Hofstra University Wednesday following a closed door meeting with his teammates over his differences with pro football Commissioner Peter Rozelle. London UPI: The House of Lords was assured Wednesday that a midget American submarine would not "damage or assault" the Loch Ness monster. Lord Nomay said he wanted to be sure anyone operating a submarine in the Loch "would not subject any creatures that might inhabit it to damage or assault." He asked that the submarine's plan to take a tissue sample with a retrievable dart from any monster it finds can be done without damage and disturbance. He was told it was impossible to say if the 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act would be violated unless and until the monster found. Over.

Roger. Go ahead, Houston.

00 23 57 10 CC
Roger. Mike, we've got some comments on performance of P23 for today if you've got a minute to talk.

00 23 57 20 CDR
He's all ears.

00 23 57 22 CMP
Yes. Go ahead.

00 23 57 25 CC
Okay. For today, we'd like you on P23 to make a trunnion bias determination, prior to P23 sightings as called out in procedures, and also one afterwards. Our intent here is to check out the possibility that some sort of thermal effect may be giving you errors in the angular read-out in the sextant. The bias that you get beforehand should be incorporated, that is a PROCEED on NOUN 87 after you get two consecutive measurements equal to within 0.003 degrees. And, of course, move the trunnion off a couple of degrees between the measurements. The Earth should be a lot smaller in your field of view today. I'm , sure you're a lot more qualified to tell us about that than we are, but to ensure that you're getting a good angle measurement between the star and the Earth horizon, the sextant M-line, which is the line that runs through the two hash marks and is perpendicular to the R-line, should be parallel to the Earth horizon at the substellar point. And then the actual superimposition of the star upon the horizon can be made at any point in the field of view of the sextant: above, below, or on the M-line. We recommend the marks be made as rapidly as possible after AUTO maneuver. If you feel that the amount of time between the AUTO maneuver and the time you get ready to mark is excessive, or that you don't like that AUTO maneuver attitude when you get ready to mark, of course, you can use a VERB 94 - VERB 94 to get you back to the flashing 51 position to redo the AUTO maneuvers.

Go ahead, 11.

01 00 02 13 CMP
Okay. We're stopping PTC now and maneuvering to our P52 and optics CAL attitude. In regard to that P23, what I was trying to tell you yesterday was about that. The M-line is not anywhere parallel to the horizon at the roll, pitch, and yaw which you gave me to go to for the substellar point, and I was trying to maneuver off to get it parallel to the horizon when you all said that was not necessary.

01 00 02 47 CC
Roger, 11. I guess in keeping the cups of coffee score, why you get that one.

01 00 02 57 CMP
Well - Okay - Well, this morning, let's just see how close it comes to being parallel to the M-line. Before we started marking for the first time, it appeared that the computation of - of those three angles was somewhat off, and that I was wasting a lot of gas by going to those three angles and then having to make large attitude changes after that to get the M-line parallel. In some cases it appeared to be just an accepted attitude required, and you all said that it wasn't needed. So I was marking in some cases with the M-line not parallel. I thought perhaps you had some processor for computing that offset and making sense out of that data, but as far as I know, we've got to have the M-line parallel to the horizon.

01 00 03 49 CC
Roger, 11. We don't have that capability. We do require that the M-line be parallel to the horizon in order to get a good mark. We feel that possibly the - the state vector information that you were using for your maneuver basis yesterday may have needed to be updated a little. And if you'll standby a second, we'll give you an evaluation of what we feel you'll get today by the AUTO maneuver.

01 00 04 25 CMP

When you move into P23, we recommend that you use the CMC-computed angles for your AUTO maneuver and see how that works out. If it doesn't bring you up with the M-line parallel to the horizon to the substellar point, we will see if we can get you some ground-computed angles. I guess the big thing here is to make sure that the M-line is parallel to substellar points so we can get a good angular measurement. Over.

Houston, Apollo 11. Marking on this star, I get a NOUN 87 twice in a row of five balls, so that's sufficient for a count.

Okay. Now I want to go to P00, and I am going to take your three angles and do a verify of 49 maneuver to your substellar point. Okay?

01 00 29 53 CC
Okay. We recommend that for the first star, if we gave you a new state vector, we'd like to try the CMC-computed angles for your AUTO maneuver.

Okay.

01 00 31 13 CMP
No. We haven't changed any canisters this morning.

01 00 31 19 CC
Okay. Then you can plan on accomplishing that after P23 is over and you've got the LEB clear.

All right.

Houston, Apollo 11. We're in process of maneuvering to P23 in desired attitude. It likes roll 8.37, pitch 61.33, and yaw 339.87. Over.

Star 01, right near the horizon. Code 110.

Roger.

01 00 41 07 CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. On this star, the AUTO maneuver works just fine. I am right at the substellar point. Everything looks beautiful except there is no star in sight. It is just not visible.

01 00 41 20 CC
Roger. Is this for star 01?

01 00 41 23 CMP
That's correct.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 16/6 Page 73

01 00 41 29 CC
You are not getting any reflections or anything like that that would obscure your vision, are you?

01 00 41 40 CMP
Well, of course, the Earth is pretty bright, and the black sky, instead of being black, has sort of a rosy glow to it. The star, unless it is a very bright one, is probably lost somewhere in that glow, but it is just not visible. I maneuvered the reticle considerably above the horizon to make sure that the star is not lost in the brightness below the horizon. However, even when I get the reticle considerably above the horizon so the star should be seen against the black background, it still is not visible.

01 00 42 16 CC
Roger. We copy. Standby a minute, please.

01 00 42 47 CC
11, this is Houston. Can you read us the shaft and trunnion angle off the counters?

01 00 42 55 CMP
Yes. I will be glad to. Shaft 331.2 and trunnion 35.85.

01 00 43 04 CC
Roger. Thank you.

01 00 45 35 CMP
It's really a fantastic sight through that sextant. A minute ago, during that AUTO maneuver, the reticle swept across the Mediterranean. You could see all of North Africa, absolutely clear; all of Portugal, Spain, southern France; all of Italy, absolutely clear. Just a beautiful sight.

01 00 45 54 CC
Roger. We all envy you the view up there.

But still no star.

01 00 47 23 CMP
Roger. Go ahead, Bruce.

01 00 47 25 CC
On our ground computers we confirm the shaft and trunnion angle that you have as being pointed at the star. However, it looks as though that shaft and trunnion angle is also pointing into the structure of the LM, so that while you will be getting the Earth's horizon, the star ... is obscured by the LM. We recommend an AUTO maneuver to the attitudes pen-and-inked into the flight plan. Roll 1772, pitch 2982 and yaw 330.0. Over.

I've got a comment about the point on the Earth where the Sun's rays reflect back up toward us. In general, the color of the oceans is mostly uniform and it's bright and darker blue except for that region that's about one-eighth of an Earth's radius in diameter; and in this circular area, the blue of the water turns a grayish color, and I'm sure that's where the Sun's rays are being reflected back on up toward us. Over.

01 03 22 41 CC
Roger, Buzz. We noticed the same thing. It's very similar to looking at a light shining on something like a billiard ball or a bowling ball. You get this bright spot in the blue of the water, and that turns it to sort of a grayish color.

Yes, I'm happy with the last updates we got, you know, in terms of what it did to our state vector. Still not altogether happy with the various procedures. If we could pick stars within the smaller range of trunnion angles so that you could allow P23 to pick its own maneuver and go to that substellar point and then have that star visible, that would seem to me to be the simplest and best way to do it.

Yes. We're far enough out now that the - I think the horizon definition variation is lost in the North.

Looks like the best way to get a steady view through the monocular is just steady it out and let it close when it's in front of your eye, and then you kind of float up next to it so that you're not touching it at all. It has a very slow drift, and you get a better - steadier view that way.

01 03 27 25 CC
Sounds good.

01 03 27 47 CC
How does it feel to be airborne again, Buzz?

01 03 27 51 LMP
Well, I'll tell you, I've been having a ball floating around inside here, back and forth up to one place and back to another. It's like being outside, except more comfortable.

01 03 28 04 CC
It's a lot bigger than our last vehicle.

01 03 28 06 CMP

01 03 28 10 CMP
Say again about Buzz -

01 03 28 11 LMP
Yes. It sure is nice in here.

01 03 28 13 CC
I said it's a lot bigger than the last vehicle that Buzz and I were in.

01 03 28 17 CMP
Oh, yes. It's been nice. I've been very busy so far. I'm looking forward to taking the afternoon off. I've been cooking, and sweeping, and almost sewing, and you know, the usual little housekeeping things.

01 03 28 30 CC
It was very convenient the way they put the food preparation system right next to the NAV station.

Not if you're in the ...

01 03 28 53 CDR
Jim, it's been a little warm in the machine throughout yesterday and last night during the PTC. It cooled off somewhat with the windows buttoned up, and we've seen suit temperatures of about - the high 40's and cabin temperatures in the low 60's. But this seems to be still a little bit on the warm side.

01 03 29 28 CC
I understand that it got a little warm during the day and cooled down a little bit when you put the shades up, but you're still a little bit warm. Do you have any moisture condensation or anything like that on the wall?



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 18/8 Page 87

01 03 29 40 CDR
No, we haven't been able to detect any moisture anyplace in the spacecraft. It seems to be fine.

01 03 29 50 LMP
One of the hydrogen filters - the one that we've got on the hot water - seems to keep flowing when you remove one of the food bags from it. Its flow rate is quite small, right near the end of one out, and that contributes a little bit of moisture to the atmosphere.

01 03 30 16 CMP
Yes, that hydrogen thing, it's - I'm not sure, but I think it's a backpressure problem. If the thing sees any backpressure at all, like when the bag is attached, well the flow rate will slowly decrease to where it's almost zero, and you wait, and you wait, and you wait for that last ounce. You think you have its and you remove the bag, and then you very rapidly thereafter see maybe a glob the size of a dime or a quarter come out and just hang there. That appears to be true even though the opening into the bag is not restricted.

01 03 30 49 CC
Understand.

01 03 30 54 LMP
In general, I think they do quite a good job, especially on the guns, in removing a lot of the hydrogen bubbles.

01 03 31 04 CC
Have the water temperatures been good? Are you getting hot water?

01 03 31 12 LMP
Yes. It seems reasonably warm.

01 03 31 17 CMP
We made three cups of coffee today. The last one - you know when all the plumbing was warmed up, the hydrogen gun and everything, was warmest of the three. I don't know who had that one - Neil, did you have that one? How was your coffee? You didn't drink it till later, did you? Anyway, it's pretty good. It's not piping hot, but it sure beats stone-cold coffee.

01 03 31 49 CMP
Jim, we've been sitting here a little over 20 minutes now, How does the thruster firing activity look? Are you ready to go on with this PTC?

01 03 31 56 CC

Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.

01 03 47 27 CDR
Go ahead, Houston.

01 03 47 29 CC
Roger. If you're free for a couple of minutes, we have a procedure here that will let us verify the O2 flow transducer and at the same time get some more of our cabin enrichment out of the way. Over.

01 03 47 46 CDR
Stand by.

01 03 48 37 CDR
Go ahead, Houston. We're ready to copy.

01 03 48 41 CC
Roger. The primary purpose of this is, as I mentioned, to let us check out your O2 flow transducer. However, we still need about 2 hours' worth of cabin enrichment, so we'd like to keep the vent that we're going to set up going for this purpose. Okay. We want you to install the cabin vent quick disconnect which you'll find in compartment R-6, that is Romeo 6, on the urine connector on panel 251. When this is completed, verify that the waste stowage vent valve is closed, and then open or position the waste management overboard drain to the DUMP position. Over.

01 03 49 40 CDR
Okay. Understand that. Install the cabin quick disconnect out of R-6 on the 251 urine connector and verify that the waste dump valve is closed, and say again the last part.

01 03 50 02 CC
Roger. And then put the waste management overboard drain valve into the DUMP position. Over.

01 03 50 16 CDR
Roger. Put the waste management overboard drain valve to the DUMP position.

01 03 50 20 CC
Right. That's the one down on panel 251 also. And we'll watch your O2 flow on telemetry down here.

01 03 52 49 CDR
Okay, Houston. That configuration is set up.

01 03 52 57 CC
11, this is Houston. Say again, please.

You do have the O2 flow transducer checkout setup accomplished.

01 03 53 08 CC
Okay. Understand you have opened the drain valve at this time.

01 03 53 13 CDR
That's ... It's in DUMP.

01 03 53 15 CC
Roger. We're not getting telemetry data from you right due to low signal strength. There it comes back. I expect it'll probably take us anywhere from 15 minutes to half an hour to see an increase in O2 flow due to the size of the cabin and of course of the small size of the drain. Over.

01 03 53 36 CDR

Houston, Apollo 11.

01 04 07 18 CC
Go ahead, 11.

01 04 07 21 CMP
Roger. I've got the world in my window for a change and looking at it through the monocular, it's really something. I wish I could describe it properly. The weather is very good. South America is coming around into view. I can see on the - what appears to me to be upper horizon, a point that must be just about Seattle, Washington, and from there I can see all the way down to the southern tip of Tierra del Fuego and the southern tip of the continent.

01 04 07 55 CC
Roger. Sounds like you've got a beautiful view up there.

01 04 08 01 CMP
Absolutely fantastic. I hope the pictures come out. We,re rotating around where it's going out of view again.

01 04 08 09 LMP
I'm waiting to pick it up in the sextant.

Apollo 11, this is Houston. Negative. We had a command computer at the Madrid site go down. We had to switch over to Ascension temporarily. We're now back remoting through Madrid, and the computer is back, and we're ready to resume control of your OMNI's and full communication. Over.

Okay. The LM/CM DELTA-P is 0.98.

01 04 37 10 CC
Roger. 0.98, and what have you been reading for O2 flow on your onboard gage? Over.

01 04 37 23 LMP
Well, right now, after we put that gadget in, we've got it back to 0.35. Before that, we were reading on scale level. I think ours is relatively correct, at least when time comes for the water accumulator to kick in at 10 seconds, it goes on up to about 0.75, 0.8, something like that.

01 04 37 50 CC
This is Houston. Roger. Out.

01 04 38 43 CC
And, 11, this is Houston. A little more information based on our analysis of your last SPS burn: it looks like you got a good solid burn there. We show 94 psi chamber pressure and it looks like the SPS is definitely GO. Over.

Okay. Bruce, we're coming up on the water accumulator activity, and it's going on up to 0.85, oh, about 0.95 and it reached a peak there and then gradually dropped back on down to 0.6 now, 0.4, and it looks like it's pretty well - pretty well leveling off back down to 0.35. Over.

Roger. On that 2O flow transducer down here on telemetry, our values are agreeing pretty well with what you read out onboard, and the EECOMM's have been noticing this cycle, but it still looks like the indicated rate is lower than what we would expect. We're still working on the problem, and we'll let you have a more complete diagnosis on it in a little while.

Roger, 11. We've been watching your activity on the DSKY there, and by selecting another major program with a VERB 37 ENTER and all that, we show you collapsing the deadband in PTC and having driven the CMC rate from 0.3 degrees per second down to 0 degrees per second, although of course, with all the AUTO RCS coils shut off, you're not firing any thrusters. 0ver.

Okay. What do you recommend?

01 05 32 59 CC
Well, you can just continue in your present configuration in PTC. However, if you go to turn any thrusters on, the CMC would then try to bring you into an attitude hold position rather than continuing with the PTC. Over.

Roger. Our report from outside says that it's raining out here, and looks like you've got a pretty good eye for the weather there.

Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.

01 05 58 22 CDR
Go ahead, Houston.

01 05 58 23 CC
11, this is Houston. As a result of our venting through the waste management drain, we've concluded that your O2 flow rate sensor is, in fact, malfunctioning. I mentioned when you talked us through the cyclic water accumulator dump that even though it was moving, probably indicating a higher flow rate, it didn't seem to be indicating a flow rate that is high enough; and based on that and the flow that we're getting right now, we've concluded that the transducer is malfunctioning. We'd like to continue the O2 flow for about another hour, shutting it off at about 31 hours GET, to get the O2 concentration in the vehicles up to - in the vehicles up to where it will be acceptable for LM checkout. Over.

01 05 59 27 CDR
Okay. Does it look to you like it just has a bias on it?

01 05 59 45 CC
Roger, 11. It does seem to be a bias. Looks like it has a fairly high threshold before it starts indicating. EECOMM seems to think, though, that for high flow rate purposes, it will still give you a relative indication during the mission. Over.

Say again about the vertical lines, Buzz.

Hello, 11. Houston. The Goldstone TV said that when you get a sharp vertical line on the picture, when the horizontal banding goes across, it does appear to bend it slightly. The same as Apollo 10, they said. Looks okay to them. Over.

01 07 03 47 LMP
Okay. Understand. It's not our monitor. It must be the transmitter or the system.

01 07 03 52 CC
Roger. I guess so, Buzz. We'll have them look into it, and see if they can suggest anything.

01 07 05 12 CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've lost our command interface with Goldstone. We'd like you to switch to 0MNI Delta. Over.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to terminate the O2 purge if you have not done so already, and the TV camera people say that the lines are inherent in the camera, Buzz; and it's something that we expected. Over.

01 07 07 41 LMP
Roger. Understand about the camera. Say again about the O2 purge.

01 07 07 44 CC
Roger. We can terminate the O2 purge at this time. Over.

Charlie, how far out can you pick up TV off the 0MNI?

01 07 14 27 CC
Stand by.

01 07 14 47 CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're just about to the limits where we can get any kind of picture at all on the OMNI's on the TV. It - The picture, I guess, would be just almost zero at this point.

01 07 15 02 CMP
Okay. Well, for this TV program coming up in a couple of hours, you might give some thought to how you want us to stop PTC, if you do, for the best high gain angle; and also it would be nice if you could stop us at such an attitude that we'd have the Earth out of one of our windows.

01 07 15 21 CC
Roger, 11. We're thinking about that.

You've got it.

01 07 19 07 CC
Okay. Thank you much. Our biggest drift on the GYRO's is 0.03 degrees per hour with - on the X-GYRO. On the PIPA's, the Y-PIPA's the biggest and it's 0.006 feet per second so ... trying to tweak it up. The biggest we have is about one sigma on both GYRO's and accelerometers.

01 07 19 33 CDR
Sounds good.

Boy, you sure get a different perspective in this thing in zero g. Right now, Neil's got his feet on the forward hatch, and he can with his arms reach - all five windows, He can reach down into - the LEB where the overboard drain is. He can practically reach over in the cockpit.

Sounds like Plastic Man to me.

Be a good idea, Mike.

01 07 25 18 LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. You got a cloud over the Houston area right now?

01 07 25 24 CC
Roger. We just had a really big thunderstorm here about a hour ago. Couple of storms around the area ... Over.

01 07 25 28 LMP
Yes. I see one fairly large and isolated one. There are couple of more off to the left, but this one looks fairly good size. It could very well be the one that just passed over you.

01 07 25 33 CC
Roger.

01 07 25 34 LMP
Yes, and it looks like the Cape has been having a little bit of rain, too.

01 07 25 47 CC
Roger. The one we had here came in from the west and is moving east - or nearly so, as far as I could tell.

01 07 25 59 LMP
That view through this sextant is fantastic. I can see Alaska right up - right up along the LM, and I'm running the crosshairs right now down the coast of California, the west coast of Mexico, Yucatan Peninsula, up around the Gulf, Florida, Cuba, down Central America, and I'm running into the stop right now, on the sextant.

01 07 26 44 CC
Roger. It sounds like a pretty fantastic view.

01 07 26 51 LMP
The guys in the weather office at Patrick wanted a report on the tops but I guess all we can say is we're above them.

11, Houston. Do you see any predominant weather systems as far as frontal type or any buildup of tropical-storm type? Over.

01 07 27 25 LMP
Not any large ones. There are a couple of smaller disturbances. Well, there's one maybe 300 miles north of Cuba, but it doesn't look cyclonic.

Roger.

01 08 24 58 CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We got a TV attitude for you and also an update to your CMC erasable load and your alternate contingency checklist, if you could break that out too. Over.

01 08 25 16 LMP
Roger. I'm not sure I caught all of that. Go ahead with what you have.

01 08 25 23 CC
Roger, 11. If you'll break out your alternate and contingency checklist for the CSM, we got an update to some of the erasable loads on page F2-20, Over.

01 08 25 42 LMP
Okay. Be getting that out, and you can give us the attitude for TV.

01 08 25 48 CC
Roger, 11. Your TV attitude will be roll 261, pitch 090, yaw 000. High gain angle: pitch plus 28, yaw 271. That puts the left-hand window pointed at the Earth. We recommend exiting PTC with your updated procedure in the checklist. Over.

01 08 26 29 LMP
Roger. We copy roll 21 - 61, pitch 090, yaw 000, high gain pitch plus 28, yaw 271. And we'll like this with the DELTA-V that we have in the book. Over.

01 08 26 46 CC
That's affirmative.

01 08 27 01 CMP
Charlie, Apollo 11. I have a couple of questions on stopping the PTC. It seems to me the easiest way to stop it would be - we're essentially, of course, at 0 degrees yaw and closing up to 90 degrees pitch, so it's just a question of stopping at 260 roll, roughly, and - How about for a procedure going MANUAL ATTITUDE, three to RATE COMMAND and then, seeing as how our deadband has already collapsed, I'll turn on the panel 8 RCS thrusters, at which time it should stop at whatever attitude it finds itself in. And if I do all of that as it comes up on 261 degrees roll, we should stop right there. Is that sufficient?

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston with a recommendation on exiting PTCM. Over.

01 08 33 13 CMP
Go ahead.

01 08 33 14 CC
Roger, Mike. We'd like to see you go to ACCEL COMMAND on the MANUAL ATTITUDE switches. Then to turn on the AUTO RCS SELECT switches, and then go RATE COMMAND. That will prevent us from firing jets uncoupled. Over.

01 08 33 36 CMP
Okay. Fine. And I would guess go RATE COMMAND and roll first and then followed by pitch and yaw.

01 08 33 45 CC
Okay. That sounds good if - And when you get to the roll attitude desired, just go RATE COMMAND at that time and it'll stop us right on.

01 08 33 58 CMP
Yes. I agree, Charlie. That sounds right.

01 08 34 00 CC

(GOSS NET 1) Tape 21/4 Page 104

01 08 39 18 CMP
Go ahead, Charlie.

01 08 39 20 CC
Roger. Mike, when you were playing with the P37 a while ago and we collapsed the deadband back down, the DAP assumed that the deadband was centered around the new attitude that we happened to be at, at that time. Since then, we've drifted out a couple of degrees in both pitch and yaw from that attitude such that if we did the procedure as we called it up to you of going ACCEL COMMAND, turning on all of the AUTO RCS SELECT switches and then RATE COMMAND, it would attempt to fly back to the pitch and yaw attitude that it had when the deadband collapsed. We can prevent that by - just immediately prior to going to RATE COMMAND on the MANUAL ATTITUDE switches, if you cycle the SPACECRAFT CONTROL switch to SCS, then back to CMC. Over.

01 08 40 13 CMP
Sounds like a winner.

01 08 40 14 CC
Okay.

01 08 40 33 CMP
I'm not going to let these LM guys play with my DSKY anymore.

01 08 40 38 CC

Okay. We copy.

Looks like the southeast part of the country is all socked in.

01 08 50 04 LMP
California looks nice. The San Joaquin Valley shows up as a real dark spot with a lighter brown on either side of it. You can't tell that it's green. It looks just sort of dark gray or maybe even real dark blue.

How does the Mojave look? Is it clear?

01 08 50 26 LMP
Yes. As usual.

01 08 50 28 CC
Roger. The - around -

01 08 50 29 LMP
It looks like there's some clouds just to the west of the Sierras, northeast of Bakersfield a little bit; and crossing over into the Mojave from Bakersfield looks clear; and then as you get on further to the southeast of there, there's a few clouds.

01 08 50 48 CC
Roger, 11. Can you pick out Edwards in the sextant? Over.

01 08 50 58 LMP
I can see a 104 taxiing out for takeoff on the runway.

01 08 51 03 CC
Hey, man. That's super.

01 08 51 07 LMP
These dang bastards almost always have a 104 taxiing out for takeoff.

01 08 51 48 CC
11, Houston. Could you pick out anything around Edwards, a dry lake or anything? Over.

01 08 51 56 LMP
Negative, Charlie. I just - I don't have that resolution. But to give you some idea, I can - on the lower Texas coast, I can see - knowing what I'm looking for, I can see Padre Island. I can just barely make out the fact that there's a thin spit of land and then there's a little dark zone which is the Laguna Madre between it and the mainland.

Roger. Latest on Luna 15 - TASS reported this morning that the spacecraft was placed in orbit close to the lunar surface, and everything seems to be functioning normally on the vehicle. Sir Bernard Lovell said the craft appears to be in an orbit of about 62 nautical miles. Over.

01 09 38 17 CMP

And also, President Nixon has reported - or declared a day of participation on Monday for all federal employees to enable everybody to follow your activities on the surface. Many state and city governments and businesses throughout the country are also giving their employees the day off, so it looks like you're going to have a pretty large audience for the EVA.

01 10 00 06 CC
Roger.

01 10 01 16 CC
11, Houston. The definition is pretty good on our monitor here. The color is not too ..., at least on this set. Could you describe what you're looking at? Over.

01 10 01 31 CDR
Roger. You're seeing Earth, as we see it, out our left-hand window, just a little more than a half Earth. We're looking at the eastern Pacific Ocean, and the north half of the top half of the screen, we can see North America, Alaska, United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. South America becomes invisible just off beyond the terminator or inside the shadow. We can see the oceans with a definite blue cast, see white bands of major cloud formations across the Earth, and can see coastlines, pick out the western U.S., San Joaquin Valley, the Sierra mountain range, the peninsula of Baja California, and we can see some cloud formations over southeastern U.S. There's one definite mild storm southwest of Alaska, looks like about 500 to 1000 miles, and another very minor storm showing the south end of the screen near the - or a long ways off of the equator, probably 45 degrees or more south latitude. Can pick out the browns in the landforms pretty well. Greens do not show up very well. Some greens showing along the northeastern - northwestern coast of the United States and northwestern coast of Canada.

01 l0 03 44 CC
Roger, 11. It's a pretty good picture on clarity here. We're having - can you tell us - It appears to us that there are two distinct cloud- formations



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 22/3 Page 109

trending east/west, one approximately about along the equator, and one around 30 or so south latitude. Could you tell us exactly where those cross the landmasses? Over.

01 10 04 13 CDR
Yes. They cross just south of the lower part of Mexico, probably through Central America. That is the equatorial band which we assume to be the intertropical convergence zone. The other band, which stands about 30 south, correctly appears to join the equator at the far left, or just beyond the horizon on the left edge of Earth, or at least it looks like it's going to join it. We don't have an explanation for that banding.

01 10 04 53 CC
Roger, Neil. Thank you. It also appears that just to the left of the terminator, up in the northern hemisphere, there's a cloudband trending - a gap in the cloud, trending northwest/southeast. It appears to us that that comes in about over the northern United States, or perhaps the central United States. Is that about correct? Over.

01 10 05 26 CDR
I can see on the monitor the thing you were talking about, but right now I can't get my eye to the window to pick out just where it crosses the shoreline.

01 10 05 35 CC
Roger.

01 10 05 42 CC
You guys are doing a good job. It's a real steady picture, here. We're - Clarity is excellent. The color, it's - the clouds are - The whites are distinct. The rest if it looks like, to me anyway on the monitor I'm observing, is a fairly greenish blue is the way I'd describe it. Over.

01 10 06 09 CC
It appears that the - -

01 10 06 11 CDR
Well, we can't observe much green from the spacecraft.

01 10 06 18 CC
Roger. On this monitor, the landmasses appear to be just a darker grayish color rather than a brown.

01 10 06 31 CDR
Well, it's true that we do not have the depths of color at this range that we enjoyed at 50,000 miles out. However, the oceans still are a definite blue and the continents are generally brownish in cast,



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 22/4 Page 110

although it is true that they're tending more toward gray now than they were at the closer range.

01 10 07 03 CC
Roger, 11. We've been - I've just been vectored to another monitor and sure enough, the browns are coming in a lot more distinctly on the Eidephor that we have up on our screen in the control center. Over.

Okay, world, hold on to your hat. I'm going to turn you upside-down.

You don't get to do that every day.

01 10 09 32 CC
11, Houston. Could you describe, from your view, the polar cloudcap? It appears to us to extend down the western coast of North America. Would you estimate how far it extends down? Over.

01 10 14 25 CMP
Cue cards have a no. We have no intertions of competing with the professionals, believe me. We are very comfortable up here, though. We do have a happy home. There's plenty of room for the three of us and I think we're all learning to find our favorite little corner to sit in. Zero g is very comfortable, but after a while you get to the point where you sort of get tired of rattling around and banging off the ceiling and the floor and the side, so you tend to find a little corner somewhere and put your knees up or something like that to wedge yourself in, and that seems more at home.

It's a real good picture we're getting here of Commander Armstrong. We - Buzz, when you take the camera over towards the window where the Sun's shafting through, it tends to blank it out, though.

He's disappearing up into the tunnel, of course, as he would going into the lunar module, only backwards.

While we're pointing up in this direction, we see out our side windows the Sun going by and, of course, out one of our windows right now we've got the Earth. Now right behind my window, of course, we have the Sun, because the Sun is illuminating the star charts that we see. This line represents the ecliptic plane and these lines, vertical lines, represent our reference system that the spacecraft is using at this time.

Roger, 11. The problem on that initially - starting up the PTC was we failed to do the VERB 49 which - and load the desired initial attitude; so the DAP tried to take it back to the old attitude that we had started up in number of hours to go. That's why we picked up the rates in the other axes. We're going to wait in this attitude for about 20 minutes to dump out the rates again, and than we'll proceed with the VERB 49 and load our attitude that we have at the time - at this time. Over.

Roger. We've finally gotten concurrence on our problem here with 50 guys looking at it. When we were sitting in the 5018, we attempted to load the erasable before you terminated the VERB 49. So Mike, what we're going to have to do is call up the present CDU's, copy those down, and do a VERB 49, load the present, then do a PROCEED, then an ENTER, and then we can then set up ATTITUDE HOLD in step 6. Over.

01 11 58 03 CMP
Okay. I think that's what we did last time.

01 11 58 10 CC
It appeared to us that we attempted to load the erasable prior to entering on the VERB 49 which VERB 49 was still running, and it clobbered the CDU's. Over.

Roger. Mike, I think we can explain that seventenths rate. When we - the first time through, you know, we failed to go through the VERB 49, so we had a large error between our actual CDU and desired CDU in roll. And with that situation,



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 24/2 Page 128

the DAP - the vehicle will roll - will maneuver, rather, at a rate that is loaded in, which was three-tenths plus four-tenths rate, and it will limit at four-tenths above the desired rate, so - that is if we have a large enough angle between the desired and the actual, which we did. So, therefore, the rate was four tenths plus three tenths to give you the seven tenths. Over.

Okay. Thank you.

Roger, 11. We'd like to perform a waste-water dump at your convenience some time in the near future here. No particular time scheduled. Down air at the time for midcourse correction 3, which is about 53 55, we're deleting midcourse correction number 3 and all the items associated with it. For your information, the calculated value of the burn for midcourse number 3 was eight tenths of a foot per second, that is 0.8 feet per second. Canceling this, if we decide to burn midcourse correction 4, this would then give you a burn for midcourse correction 4 of 2.0 feet per second. At 53 hours we have an IMU realign P52. We're requesting that you do this while in PTC, and we plan to continue PTC throughout the day. Over.

02 00 32 35 LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. We've got the continent of Africa ... facing toward us right now, and of course, everything's getting smaller and smaller as time goes on. The Mediterranean is completely clear. The Sun looks like it's about to set around Madagascar. The equatorial belt of Africa stands out quite clearly. We're seeing the dark green or a muddy colored green, compared to the sandier colors in the southern tip of Africa and, of course, the Sahara northern coast of Africa. There's a rather remarkable cloud that appears in the vicinity of the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. It's just about to go into the sunset now. It is casting quite a large shadow. It's isolated. There don't seem to be any other clouds ... the band of clouds near the tropical conversions clouds down around the equator clearly separate the clockwise and the counterclockwise cloud formations. Over.

02 00 33 57 CC
Roger, 11. We copy your word description on that. I understand you can see a shadow being cast by that cloud over between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Any estimate on how long that shadow would be? Over.

02 00 37 17 LMP
Okay. It looks as though the length of the shadow of that cloud is about the same as the width of the Persian Gulf.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 31/5 Page 139

02 00 37 26 CC
Okay. We copy the width of the Persian Gulf, and I guess that all I can give you firsthand is a single isolated data point, and that is that it was clear here in Houston this morning. That's a pretty localized observation. As a result of your waste water dump, it looks like the PTC mode has been disturbed somewhat. We're showing you about 20 degrees out in pitch right now and about 6 degrees in yaw, which is significantly greater, about twice as much - a little more than twice as much as the deviation you had prior to the waste water dump. We' re watching it down here, though, and we'll let you know if we think any corrective action is required. Over.

02 00 38 14 LMP
Okay. Maybe we ought to - next time split that in half, and put half of it on one side and half on the other or something like that.

02 00 38 25 CC
Yes. We could do that. We were actually pretty interested in seeing what the effect on PTC would be of the waste water dump. We don't recall ever having performed a waste water dump during PTC on previous missions. Over.

Well, now we know.

Apollo 11, this is Houston. We lost you down in the noise on the COMM link here about the time you were describing the single cell cloud formation over Afghanistan-Pakistan area through the sextant. Over.

02 00 45 55 LMP
Roger. It came through a lot clearer through the sextant than with the monocular, and you could definitely tell it was one single cell in the latter stages of development. It must have gone up to over 50,000 feet, though. The eastern Mediterranean is phenomenally clear. You can see all the lakes; the Dead Sea stood out quite well. Over.

My guess would be the telescope's probably pretty useless, but you can differentiate in the sextant between water droplets and stars by the difference in their motions.

02 00 50 02 CC
Okay, Mike. I guess that we've still got - what you are saying is that we've still got a lot of water droplets visible, but you can pick them out and distinguish them in the sextant, then.

02 00 50 13 CMP
Right. I think so. Buzz is looking through it now. Just a second.

02 00 50 17 CC
Okay.

02 00 56 36 LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. It looks like at this time the sextant would be quite usable for any alignment. There's actually very few ... verticals.

02 00 56 50 CC
Roger, Buzz. How about the telescope? Is it useful now?

02 00 57 02 LMP
Well, it's not quite as useful; it never seems to be. Depending on the position of the Sun, it's got that band that seems to go across the center. I don't think it's because of the waste water particles that it would lack its effectiveness. Over.

02 00 57 22 CC
Roger. What - Is this band something that's deposited on the outside of the optics? Over.

02 00 57 31 LMP
No. I see the reflection from the Sun.

02 00 57 35 CC
Roger.

02 00 57 41 CMP
The Sun bounces off the LM structure. With the LM attached, that telescope is just about useless. Those star charts that MPAD provided us, I think, would be most useful if we had to use the - if for some reason we had to mark through the telescope. We could use those as a guide for what we're looking at and say, "Well, that bright blob over there has got to be that star because that's the position we're in." But so far, we've not been able to pick out any decent star patterns while docked with the LM using the telescope.

02 01 41 45 CC
Roger.

02 01 42 40 CC
11, this is Houston. At the time of your cyclic accumulator stroking, we were on low-bit-rate data, and consequently not receiving the O2 flow parameter. We expect that what you're seeing is probably nominal. That is, it's probably what we would expect from a transducer that's malfunctioning probably in this fashion, and it's just going to keep on getting worse like that. Nothing to worry about. We'll monitor things on the ground here. Over.

Houston, Apollo 11. Would you like to have both oxygen and hydrogen purge on? Over.

02 03 59 32 CC
11, this is Houston. Say again. Both what on? Over.

02 03 59 41 LMP
On the fuel cell purge: would you like to see both oxygen and hydrogen? Over.

02 04 00 02 CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Affirmative. We request hydrogen and an oxygen fuel cell purge. Over.

02 04 00 17 LMP
Okay. Any preference which first?

02 04 00 22 CC
Negative. As long as you've got the H2 purge line heaters on.

02 04 00 29 LMP
Okay. I'll go get - Go ahead with the hydrogen then.

02 04 58 29 CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.

02 04 58 32 CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead.

02 04 58 38 CMP
Roger. You copy my NOUN 93?

02 04 58 43 CC
That's affirmative. We've got it.

02 04 58 48 CMP
Okay. I am going to go ahead and thrust then. Triangle difference is 0.01, but it's sort of difficult at three-tenths rate. I'm required to use medium speed unresolved, and it's difficult to hold the star centered long enough to get a decent mark on it.

02 04 59 15 CC
Roger. We copy. It looks okay to us.

02 04 59 22 CMP

Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.

02 05 51 42 CMP
Go ahead, Houston.

02 05 51 45 CC
Roger. I've got the morning news here if you're interested. Over.

02 05 51 51 CMP
Yes, we sure are. We're ready to copy and comment. Isn't that 2:30 there?

02 05 51 57 CC
Roger.

02 05 52 02 CDR
Okay. Go.

02 05 52 03 CC
Okay. Here we go. The interest in the Flight of Apollo 11 continues at a high level but a competing interest in the Houston area is the easing of watering rules. Mayor Louie Welch promises a lifting of lawn-watering restrictions if the rains continue. Friday is partly cloudy, and there is a 30-percent chance of thunderstorms in the afternoon. In Washington, D.C., the Senate Finance Committee approved extension of the income tax surtax, but a Senate vote on the bill - -

02 05 52 35 CMP
You cut out, Houston. You cut out.

02 05 52 40 CC
Roger. Where do you hold me cutting out? Over.

Apollo 11, Houston. Over.

02 05 54 51 CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read now? Over.

02 05 54 57 CMP
Loud and clear, Houston. Go ahead.

02 05 54 59 CC
Roger.

02 05 55 00 CMP
Start after the rains in Houston.

02 05 55 03 CC
Roger. In Washington, the Senate Finance Committee has approved extension of the income tax surtax, but a Senate vote on the bill currently seemed remote. In Austin, State Representative Ray Lemmon of Houston has been nominated as the National Director of the American Society for Oceanography. Lemmon has proposed a study of the possibility of establishing an institute of oceanography in Texas. This would be the first such institute on the western Gulf of Mexico.

In Minneapolis, Minnesota, the weather bureau, after recapping today's weather showing a high of 88 and a low of 72, has noted "snowfall: none." From St. Petersburg, Florida, comes a radio report from the Norwegian explorer, Thor Heyerdahl, which said that the crew of his papyrus boat, the Ra, will sail into Bridgetown, Barbados, despite damage from heavy seas. The crew, however, will sleep on an escort vessel. Norman Baker, navigator of the expedition, said the crew was aboard the Ra today repairing damage from storms this past week, which split the footing of the mast. Part of the broken mast was jettisoned overboard, and the vessel was 725 miles east of the Barbados. "It is possible but uncomfortable to sleep aboard the Ra," Baker said in the radio report. "But the purpose of our voyage is not a test of strength or human endurance." That is the reason why the crew was spending nights aboard the escort vessel Shenandoah, which rendezvoused with the Ra on Tuesday.

In sports, the Houston Oilers are showing plenty of enthusiasm in their early preseason workouts at Kerrville, and Coach Wally Lemm says he is impressed with the fine group of rookies. National League baseball yesterday, Thursday: St. Louis 11, Philadelphia 3; Montreal 5, over Pittsburg 4; Atlanta 12, Cincinnati 2; San Fransciso 14, and Los Angeles 13. American League: we have Baltimore 3, over Cleveland 2; Detroit 4 to Washington's 3; Minnesota 8 to Chicago 5. Boston at New York was rained out. And in Corby, England, an Irishman, John Coyle has won the world's porridge eating championship by consuming 23 bowls of instant oatmeal in a 10-minute time limit from a field of 35 other competitors. Over.

02 05 57 48 CMP
Roger. I assume Houston didn't play yesterday.

02 05 57 51 CC
That's correct.

02 05 57 55 CMP
I'd like to enter Aldrin in the oatmeal eating contest next time.

02 05 58 00 CC
Is he pretty good at that?

02 05 58 04 CMP
He's doing his share up here.

02 05 58 13 CC
Let's see. You all just finished a meal not long ago, too, didn't you?

02 05 58 20 LMP
I'm still eating.

02 05 58 24 CC
Okay. Does that - that - -

02 05 58 27 CMP
He's on his - He's on his 19th bowl.

02 05 58 30 CC
Roger. Are you having any difficulties with gas in the food bags like the 10 crew reported?

02 05 58 40 CMP
Well, that's intermittently affirmative, Bruce. We have these two hydrogen filters, which work fine as long as you don't hook them up to a food bag. But the entry way into the food bag has enough back pressure to cause the - the filters to start losing their efficiency. A couple of times, I've been tempted to go through that dryout procedure, but we found that simply by leaving the filters alone for a couple of hours, their efficiency seems to be restored.

02 05 59 14 CC
Roger. We copy.

02 05 59 23 CMP
Their efficiency ranges anywhere from darn near perfect to terrible just depending on the individual characteristics of the food bags we're putting through them. Some of the food bags are so crimped near the entry-way that there's no way we can work them loose to prevent back pressure.

02 05 59 44 CC

Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.

02 06 34 32 CDR
Hello, Houston. Go ahead.

02 06 34 33 CC
Roger, 11. As you've probably noticed, your coning angle in PTC mode is increased substantially as a result of the waste water dump, the fuel cell purge, and a natural coupling, so it looks like we are going to have to terminate PTC here in a little while. And we'd like to get your feeling as to whether you're still anticipating trying to send back TV signals from inside the LM; and if so, we'll try to provide an attitude that you can hold that'll give us high gain antenna lock on the Earth during the TV and LM activation period. Over.

02 06 35 18 CDR
Yes, we're still planning that activity if the cord lengths work out all right, and we'll accept those attitudes that you work up for us.

02 06 35 29 CC
This is Houston. Roger. Out.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 35/4 Page 149

02 06 35 34 LMP
When you work up an attitude to get high gain, is there any way that we could get partial Sun in one of the two LM front windows?

02 06 35 46 CC
This is Houston. We'll have a look at it.

02 06 39 14 CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.

02 06 39 20 CDR
Go ahead, Houston.

02 06 39 21 CC
Roger. We have a TV attitude for you if you're ready to copy.

02 06 39 32 CMP
Go ahead. Ready to copy.

02 06 39 35 CC
Okay. We recommend stopping PTC at GET of 54 45 00, and this should put you at just about the right roll angle. The attitude we recommend is roll 263, pitch 090, yaw 000. This gives you the Earth out of window number 1 in the command module and places the high gain antenna in the CSM window for TV at your convenience. You will also have the Sun shining in - or shining at the hatch on the LM, and if you take down the window shades you should get some sunlight in. We're recommending wide deadband. Over.

02 06 40 36 CMP
Roger. Thank you, Houston. We'll look at that.

02 06 40 41 CC
Roger. Out.

02 06 42 53 CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. When we pass the proper roll angle, we're not going to be anywhere near zero degrees yaw. Do you want us to just stop and try until we find ourselves in and then VERB 49 the three angles you gave us?

02 06 43 06 CC
Stand by.

02 06 43 20 CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to stop at the proper roll angle, then do a VERB 49 to the roll and pitch. Over. Correction, roll and yaw.

02 06 43 52 CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.

02 06 43 54 CC
Go ahead, 11. Over.

02 06 44 12 CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Do you read? Over.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.

02 06 44 46 CMP
Stand by, Charlie. Yes, we'r going to come out of PTC here at 263 roll and then do VERB 49 to thc recommended attitude.

02 06 44 58 CC
That sounds fine to us. Ovcr.

02 06 46 56 CC
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Before you open the pressure equalization valve, we'd like the LM/CM DELTA-P. Over.

02 06 47 06 CMP
Okay. Let me check it again. It was about 155.

02 06 47 12 CC
Roger.

02 06 47 14 CMP
I read it 158 right now, Charlie.

02 06 47 17 CC
Roger. Thank you much.

02 06 49 51 CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. We're stopping PTC at 263 ... 0.

02 06 49 59 CC
11, Houston. You're about one-by on this transmission. Say again. Over.

02 06 50 08 CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Do you read?

02 06 51 46 CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read on the high gain?

02 06 51 50 CC
11, how do you read me? Over.

02 06 51 55 CMP
Read you loud and clear, Charlie. We just switched to HIGH GAIN, and we stopped PTC at roll 263, pitch 90, yaw 0. How do you read?

02 06 52 03 CC
Roger, Mike. You're five-by now on the high gain. We're right between the 0MNI antennas and pretty horrible COMM on the OMNI's. We got you five-by on the high gain, and we copy the PTC stoppage. Over.

02 06 52 18 CMP
Okay, fine.

02 06 52 35 CMP
Houston, we're going to open the DIRECT O2 valve and start pumping up the cabin.

02 06 52 40 CC
Roger. Copy.

02 06 53 06 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We're going to hand over to Goldstone for uplink in about 2 minutes. We might have a momentary dropout of COMM. Over.

02 06 53 16 CMP
Alright. Can you hear our master alarm in the background? That's O2 FLOW HIGH coming through this amplifier.

02 06 53 27 CC
Roger. Copy.

02 06 53 37 CMP
That photoelectric cell is a good device. It's worked very well.

02 06 53 46 CC
11, Houston. Say again. Over.

02 06 53 50 CMP
I say that photoelectric cell amplifier for the master alarm is a good device. It's working very well, and it's a nice pleasing tone.

02 06 54 00 CC
Roger. Copy. Thank you.

02 06 54 08 CMP
Makes you almost glad to get master alarms.

02 06 55 01 CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. As a matter of curiosity, our O2 flow meter is pegged FULL-SCALE HIGH.

02 06 55 08 CC
Roger, 11. We copy that here. Over.

02 06 55 14 CMP
Okay.

02 06 55 26 CMP
Boy, that transducer's working somewhat.

02 06 55 32 CC
Roger.

02 06 55 51 CC
11, Houston. We'd like to try to attempt to correlate your O2 flow in transducer with the flow valve that you've got open. How far - How far open would you say you have the REPRESS O2? 0ver. Correction, the DIRECT O2.

02 06 56 10 CMP
Stand by, Charlie.

02 06 56 19 CMP
Okay, Charlie. It's not open very far. It's hard to give you a good reading without shunting it again, but the arrow is at about the one o'clock position. Now I reduce the flow, and I'll let it stabilize here. Right now our onboard reading is about 0.4, and that's with the arrow in the O2 valve at the two o'clock position. Would you rather have comparisons of O2 flow readings or would you rather have valve position comparisons?

02 06 56 48 CC
Roger. Stand by.

02 06 56 52 CC
EECOMM's say they'd like to look at valve positions. Over.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 35/7 Page 152

02 06 57 01 CMP
Okay. Well, we're holding steady now at 0.3 pound per hour, and our cabin pressure is about 54; and I'll close the valve momentarily and then open it again to this position and tell you how much travel is required.

02 06 57 18 CC
Roger.

02 06 57 29 CMP
It's about 30 degrees of travel, Charlie, from the closed position, which is with the arrow pointing at about three to three-thirty, four o'clock.

02 06 57 38 CC
Roger.

02 06 57 47 CMP
Our flow is stabilized now at 0.6.

02 06 57 55 CC
Roger. We copy. We're reading the same.

02 06 58 00 CMP
Okay.

02 06 58 06 CMP
Yes, open it back to the one o'clock position.

02 06 58 10 CC
Roger.

02 06 58 31 CMP
Is that enough different positions, or you want more, Charlie?

02 06 58 36 CC
Mike, that's good - good enough. We're satisfied now. Over.

02 06 58 42 CMP
Okay.

Houston, Apollo 11. We've terminated direct O2, our cabin pressure is 57, and, as a matter of curiosity, when we turn the DIRECT O2 valve OFF, we get a master alarm just like they did in the spacecraft testing.

02 07 02 17 CC
Roger.

02 07 02 20 CC
11, Houston, we have a little update for you. When you go into the LM, we'd like you to unstow and bring back to the command module the following items. Over.

Apollo 11, Houston. The reason we wanted you to bring those three items back, we'll have some updates for you, for those three. Over.

02 07 04 45 CMP
Roger. We figured you would.

02 07 09 58 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We're getting the TV at Goldstone. We're not quite configured here at Houston for the transmission. We'll be up in a couple of minutes. Over.

02 07 10 17 CC
Roger.

02 07 19 49 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. It's a pretty good show here. It looks like you almost got the probe out.

02 07 19 54 CMP
Yes, it's loose now.

02 07 19 55 CDR
Can you see that?

02 07 19 58 CC
Roger, Neil. It's really good.

02 07 20 03 CDR
Not much light up in that area, but apparently the TV set's able to pick it up.

02 07 20 10 CC
There are some bright spots shining on the probe. Apparently Sun shafting on it that just gets just about enough for us to make it out. Over.

Oh, Okay. You're right.

02 07 20 32 CDR
Okay. It's loose now. Coming down.

02 07 20 35 CC
Roger.

02 07 20 57 CC
Looks like it's a little bit easier than doing that in the chamber.

02 07 21 04 CDR
You bet. This is the only way ...

02 07 21 05 CMP
You have to take it easy.

02 07 21 06 CDR
It's pretty massive, but it goes where you direct it.

02 07 21 11 CC
11, Houston. That's a beautiful picture now, we've got. We're looking at a 12-second delay. To us you are just bringing it down by the optics now.

02 07 21 27 CDR
Mike must have done a smooth job in that docking. There isn't a dent or a mark on the probe.

Roger.

02 07 21 38 CC
We're really getting a great picture here, 11. Over.

02 07 22 00 CC
11, Houston. With a 12-foot cable, we estimate you should have about 5 to 6 feet excess when you get the camera into the LM. Over.

Okay. Drogue removal's coming next.

02 07 23 06 CC

We see lots of arms.

02 07 25 20 LMP
The only problem, Charlie, is these TV stagehands don't know where they stand.

02 07 25 27 CC
Well, you got to really have a union card, there. We can't really complain too much, I guess.

02 07 26 28 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Do you have a little white dot in the bottom of your monitor - TV monitor? Over.

02 07 26 39 LMP
Roger. We do.

02 07 26 41 CC
Roger. I guess part of the camera's been burnt out down there. These are really beautiful pictures now, Buzz. Over. Real clear.

02 07 26 56 LMP
Okay. We might have got just a little bit of Sun in there. Is it just one small white dot?

02 07 27 01 CC
That's affirmative.

02 07 27 42 CMP
We went up in the tunnel checking the roll angle, Charlie, and it's 2.05 degrees.

02 07 27 48 CC
Roger. Copy. 2.05 on the roll CAL.

02 07 27 55 CMP
And that's a plus.

02 07 29 08 CC
11, Houston. The lighting up in there looks very good to us at this time. Over.

02 07 29 22 CDR
I think that's mostly the camera. It - it's subdued to say the least.

02 07 29 30 CC
Roger. It's pretty - It's gathering pretty well to us. We see everything quite clearly up in there.

02 07 30 05 CMP
Well, the docking latches look good today just like they did yesterday. Everything up in there looks just fine.

02 07 30 12 CC
That sounds fine to us. Over.

02 07 30 45 CC
11, Houston. We can even read the decals up there on the LM hatch.

02 07 30 53 LMP
Well, let me zoom it up and see how much you can read.

02 07 30 57 CC
Okay.

02 07 31 11 CC
We can see the LM umbilical connection quite well there, Buzz. We see you zooming in on one of the decals now. It's, "To reset, unlatch handle; latch behind grip and pull back two full strokes." That's about all we can make out.

02 07 31 35 LMP
Hey, you get an A-plus.

02 07 31 37 CC
Thank you very much, sir. At least I passed my eye test.

02 07 31 46 LMP
I'm standing 6 feet from it, Charlie, and you can read it better than I can. There's something wrong with the system.

Roger. It's fine with us, Neil. Go ahead anytime you wish. Over.

02 07 33 57 CC
11, Houston. The white spot you see on your monitor, our TV people say it is a burn spot; but they expect it to dissipate after a couple of hours. Over.

11, Houston. We're really amazed at the quality of the picture up in the tunnel. It's really superb. Over.

02 07 36 18 LMP
It is, considering the amount of light up in there.

Roger. We're about to open our hatch now.

02 07 36 23 CC
Roger.

02 07 36 32 CMP
Roger. There's that same guy that, when you open up the door, why, he's waiting there for you, and he turns the lights on.

02 07 36 38 CC
How about that. Just like the refrigerator.

02 07 37 08 CC
Buzz, the view in through your - by your right - left shoulder there is so good we can see the ascent engine cover, the Velcro on it, and that's about all we can make out right now.

02 07 37 27 CC
Now we can see the helmet stowage bag - -

02 07 37 28 LMP
We don't see anything loose up there.

02 07 37 30 CC
Well, great. Looks good to us. We see the helmet storage bag.

02 07 37 53 CC
Hello, 11. Houston. We got a view of the PLSS there, off the right of our screen.

02 07 38 35 CC
11, Houston. Buzz, you already in? Over.

11, we have a good view of the window there. It looks like the Sun's finally coming through the shade.

02 07 40 00 LMP
Yes, I'm afraid it's - We're just about plus Z toward the Sun.

02 07 40 05 CC
That's affirmative. This attitude put both windows right toward the Sun - or the LM. Over.

02 07 40 15 LMP
Well, that may be good in some respects, but -

02 07 40 22 CC
We had a view, Buzz, of the utility light cord. ...

02 07 40 31 LMP
Now let me show you a view looking the other way.

02 07 40 33 CC
Roger. And we see right now the utility light or either the floodlight up there.

02 07 40 45 CC
I think now I see the utility light still in the stowage bag. Hey, that's a great shot right there. We see you in there. Guess that's Neil and Mike. Better be, anyway.

02 07 41 13 CC
We see you waving.

02 07 41 33 CC
11, Houston. That's really a beautiful shot.

02 07 41 46 CC
11, Houston. We didn't quite decipher that signal that just came from the CMP.

02 07 41 55 LMP
Just saying hello. On the LCG sight gage, you got about - oh, it looks like the white mark that's in the plunger is about a quarter to three-eighths inch out into the green away from the red. Is that what you'd like to see? Over.

02 07 42 18 CC
Stand by. Roger, Buzz. That looks good to us. Thank you much.

02 07 42 28 LMP
It is the white index, is it not, that you're interested in comparing whether it's in the red or green?

02 07 42 34 CC
Stand by. That's affirmative, Buzz. It looks good. That's a good reading for us. Over.

02 07 42 42 LMP
Okay.

02 07 42 46 CC
We had a shot moment - a moment ago of the suit disconnect valve.

02 07 42 58 LMP
I'll open up the windows and see what the lighting condition's going to be like.

02 07 43 24 CC
11, Houston. That's a real good view we have of the AOT. You're back now, Buzz, and notice you're taking down one of the window shades. Over.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 36/7 Page 159

02 07 43 36 CC
The light is superb.

02 07 43 37 LMP
How's the Sun coming in? How's the Sun coming in from this direction going to affect what you can see?

02 07 43 44 CC
It made it really super. The lighting is excellent in the - in the LM right now. We can make out the AOT, the ISA, and the left-hand window - there's a little glare off of that, but the LMP
side the - with the shade down it's really excellent. Over.

02 07 44 08 LMP
Well, let's - I'm turned around, why I took the shade off my side first.

02 07 44 16 CC
Roger. We copy. The light level for the TV is really excellent. Over.

02 07 44 29 CDR
Yes, the lighting in the LM is very nice now, just like completely daylight; and everything is visible. A good bit lighter than the tunnel was earlier.

02 07 44 43 CC
Roger. We got a good view now, Neil, of the DEDA; and also Buzz's ACA.

02 07 45 05 LMP
Hey, I'm pointing it at the front hatch now. Everything seems to be in place down there.

02 07 45 11 CC
Roger, we got the dump valves in view. Over.

02 07 45 13 LMP
Roger.

02 07 45 44 CC
11, Houston. We see you removing the ISA now, folding it up, putting it up on the AOT. The instrument panels are coming into view behind.

02 07 45 58 LMP
Yes, I think it'd probably be best, since we've done SPS burn, to put it back over the instrument panel instead of putting it up over the PLSS on the recharge station. Would you care to comment on that one? We could do either just as easily.

02 07 46 12 CC
Stand by. We'll have an answer for you momentarily.

02 07 46 18 CC
11, Houston. That's really a super shot of the main display.

The vehicle is surprisingly free of any debris floating around. It's very clean.

02 07 47 04 CC
Roger.

02 07 47 17 CC
11, Houston. It's pretty hard to describe this view. It's really - really great.

02 07 47 23 LMP
Now you know how we feel.

02 07 47 30 LMP
Okay. Neil's OPS is about 57, 5800.

02 07 47 35 CC
Copy.

02 07 47 36 LMP
And mine's about 5800, also.

02 07 47 39 CC
Copy.

02 07 48 04 CC
11, Houston. That's a good shot of Neil's PLSS, there. Over.

02 07 48 16 LMP
No, that's mine.

02 07 48 40 CC
11, Houston. That moment - a moment ago, we had a good shot of your PLSS, Buzz, and the two helmet stowage bags. Down behind your left shoulder, Buzz, we have the - the DSKY and the ACA.

02 07 50 01 LMP
We're going to go ahead and take all the Moon data on back into the command module, Charlie.

02 07 50 07 CC
Roger.

02 07 50 58 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Buzz, it appears that you're intending to put on the Sun filter and view the Sun through the AOT. Over.

02 07 51 09 LMP
Yes, unfortunately it looks like it's down a little bit more towards ... than I can be able to see in the AOT.

02 07 51 17 CC
Roger.

02 07 52 15 LMP
We got a beautiful view of the side of the command module out of the AOT looking in the left rear detent.

02 07 52 23 CC
Roger.

02 07 52 24 LMP
I can see the hatch and all the - all the EVA handrails. First time we've seen the silvery outside of the command module.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 36/9 Page 161

02 07 52 40 LMP
I can read the letters on the hatch cover. It's a boost cover release; and the big yellow arrow that points toward the opening - place where the tool B goes.

02 07 52 55 CC
Roger. Great shot now back down into the -

02 07 53 01 CMP

02 07 53 04 CC
Go ahead, Buzz. Over.

02 07 53 07 LMP
Say again.

I was just saying we got a great shot looking back into the command module.

02 07 53 O9 LMP
...

02 07 53 14 LMP
Okay. And the left detent, I can see the AO - or the rendezvous radar, and I move to the forward detent and that's about all I've got. I'm looking eyeball to eyeball.

02 07 53 25 CC
Roger.

02 07 54 08 LMP
Charlie, is there any concern about the duration that we ought to have the window shades open?

02 07 54 14 CC
Stand by.

02 07 54 17 LMP
We don't have - We don't have any circulation in here, and it might get a little on the warm side.

02 07 54 23 CC
Roger.

02 07 54 30 CMP
We'll - We'll put up a couple of hoses in the command module here and get a little circulation going.

02 07 54 36 CC
Sounds like a good idea. Over.

02 07 55 04 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. As far as the window shades go in this LM, there's nothing except for crew comfort. I don't think we've got any systems problem. Be sure to put them back up when you egress. Over.

02 07 55 17 LMP
That we will do.

02 07 55 52 LMP
Charlie, I'll give you a view out of the overhead window, back looking at the command module right-hand rendezvous window.

02 07 56 19 CC
Well, we see it now. Thanks a lot, Buzz. That's a good view through the overhead.

02 07 56 38 LMP
One washer's on by the overhead.

02 07 56 42 CC
Roger.

02 07 56 49 CC
There we go. We got it now.

02 07 56 58 LMP
There wasn't very much debris in the command module or the LM. We found very few loose particles of bolts, nuts, and screws and lint and things. Very few in each spacecraft. They were very clean.

02 07 57 14 CC
Roger. Sounds good.

02 07 57 45 CC
11, Houston. We have a good view out of the rendezvous - correction, the overhead window of the LM. We don't see anybody staring back at us, though. Over.

02 07 59 03 LMP
Charlie, can you see Mike's two eyeballs staring out through the rendezvous window?

02 07 59 11 CC
11, Houston. Stand by. We haven't picked him up yet.

02 07 59 22 LMP
You are looking through a lot of layers of glass.

02 07 59 38 CC
11, Houston. We had a - -

02 07 59 40 LMP
... on my monitor.

02 07 59 41 CC
We had a slight glimpse of Mike in the rendezvous window at that time. It's pretty murky looking into there, though.

02 07 59 48 LMP
Okay. Here he is; I've got him. I've got, him on the monitor now.

02 07 59 55 CC
Okay. We see him staring back at us now. Hello, in there.

02 08 00 28 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Our recommendation for the ISA is to stow it back over the instrument panel. Over.

02 08 00 42 LMP
Roger. Will do.

02 08 01 56 CC
11, Houston. We can make out the markings on the panel. We read SYSTEM A ASCENT FUEL, ASCENT OXIDIZER. Quad 1, quad 4. The - It's really unbelievable, the definition we're getting down here off that little camera. Over.

02 08 02 14 CC
We can even see the barber pole on the talkbacks.

02 08 02 24 CC
We can read the markings on the instruments for the glycol pressure, quantity, PCO2. You can even read the scale on the eight ball. Over.

02 08 02 58 CC
11, Houston. We see the cross-feed barber pole, and we have the Velcro patches back up to the RCS systems now. We can see the markings on the meters, green and red bands, in limits.

02 08 03 27 CC
We see you raised the cover on the abort stage. We don't recommend that.

02 08 03 34 LMP
Yes. We're going to tape that one over.

02 08 03 35 CC

02 08 03 36 LMP
We're going to tape that one over.

02 08 03 37 CC
We concur.

02 08 03 44 LMP
The restraints in here do a pretty good job of pulling my pants down.

02 08 03 53 CC
Roger. We haven't quite got that before the 50,000,000 TV audience, yet.

02 08 04 17 CC
11, Houston. That's a good view of the eight ball. We see - You can even read the OFF flag, there.

02 08 04 30 CC
You can see the signal strength meter for the radar, read the numbers on it.

02 08 04 54 LMP
Houston, did you want us to test the cameras in the LM and - I was wondering about that. I saw it in the flight plan, but I'm just wondering if you want to do that on CSM power, or do you want us to take both of the 16mm cameras back in the CSM and test them there? Over.

02 08 05 18 CC
Stand by, Buzz.

02 08 05 21 LMP
As an alternative to that, why, we could wait LOI day and do it then when we transfer over to LM power.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 36/12 Page 164

02 08 05 32 CC
Roger. Stand by. We'll have an answer.

02 08 05 47 CC
11, Houston. On that TV, our commentary - The monitor I was looking at was delayed about 12 seconds, 12 to 15 seconds while it went through our color converter. It was probably - You thought I was crazy, but we were looking at it 15 seconds after you broadcast it. 11, Houston - -

02 08 06 06 LMP
We understood that, Charlie.

02 08 06 08 CC
Okay. On the LM cameras, we'd like you to do it on LOI day with the LM power. Over.

02 08 06 19 LMP
Okay. That's what we'll do.

02 08 07 16 LMP
Houston, we're showing you something that came out of the Commander's checklist stowage packet. It's got a 16-millimeter camera in it, and it's got this little cylinder; and I guess - I don't understand what it is. Maybe you can tell us.

02 08 07 35 CC
Roger. Stand by. We can't figure it out either.

02 08 07 46 LMP
It's got an arrow on the back, and it says "turn," but I'm afraid to turn it.

02 08 07 56 CC
11, your friendly geologist says it's the camera cank- crank, excuse me, for the 16-sequence camera if it jams. Over.

02 08 08 10 LMP
All very well. Thank you.

There's that word again. The ancillary stowage container.

Houston, 11. Are you still getting high bit rate off the OMNI's at this distance?

02 08 09 56 CC
Stand by, Mike.

02 08 10 07 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. About 50 percent of the time, we're getting high bit rate off the OMNI's when you're in PTC. Over.

You're welcome.

Apollo 11, Houston. Neil, at this attitude you look like you're about 12 feet long.

02 08 11 34 CDR
It seems like I always find myself upside-down in whatever I'm doing around here.

02 08 12 29 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Could you give us a few comments on your crew comfort with the CSM hoses moving the air around? Over.

02 08 12 42 LMP
Well, it's picking up a little bit on circulation in here.

02 08 12 47 CC
What do you estimate the temperature is, Buzz? Over.

02 08 12 57 LMP
Oh, I'd say maybe 73, 75.

02 08 13 02 CC
Roger.

02 08 13 06 LMP
It's hard to tell at this density and pressure of gas, but comfort level is about the - about the same as the command module.

02 08 13 20 CC
You probably - -

02 08 13 21 LMP
It was a little warmer or stuffier when we first got in, but it seems to be improving.

You may be able to see some - -

02 08 14 31 CC
Go ahead.

02 08 14 32 LMP
- - some particles jumping around on your screen. That's just dust particles that are being illuminated by Sun shafting in the window.

02 08 14 42 CC
Roger. They're very clear now. Over. And that's a good view of Neil's - correction, of Buzz's circuit breaker panel, there.

02 08 15 50 LMP
I can just barely see the handrail on the front porch from the position on the right-hand window.

02 08 15 59 CC
Roger.

02 08 16 15 CC
11, Houston. Our view of the Panel 11 is - gets brighter, then darker. Are you changing the f-stop at all? Over.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 36/14 Page 166

02 08 16 32 LMP
No, what's happening is, we get pretty close to the window now and then, and it drives the automatic light control into the stop, I think.

02 08 16 42 CC
I think that's right.

02 08 16 51 LMP
Yes, I had the switch on OUTSIDE while I was going through the overhead window. That may be what's contributing to some of it.

02 08 16 58 CC
Roger.

02 08 17 05 CC
11, Houston. We seem to be picking up a few more dust particles now. We see them quite clearly in the screen now. Over.

02 08 17 17 LMP
Yes, I'm choking on one every so often.

02 08 17 41 CC
11, Houston. Your show is going out to the U.S. now. We're about to get the satellite up. It'll be transmitted to some other countries after that. Over.

Roger. I'm checking out this window bracket where I'll be putting it for the EVA pictures of Neil going down the ladder.

02 08 18 08 CC
Roger.

02 08 18 17 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We keep marveling about the color and the clarity of the picture. It's really difficult to describe. It's - It's just perfect. Over.

02 08 18 31 CC
And, 11, it doesn't look like you're having too much trouble with that bracket up there, Buzz.

02 08 18 41 LMP
I'll tell you, those new knobs really make it easy to twist the thing and get it cinched down quite tight.

02 08 18 50 CC
Roger.

02 08 20 06 CC
11, Houston. Buzz, how does the alignment look, there?

02 08 20 13 LMP
It looks pretty good, as well as I can tell without the gear extended. I can't get a real definitive answer, but you couldn't fix it any place to see much more out of the window without hand-holding it for the whole time.

02 08 20 29 CC
Roger. Looks like to us it's going to work real well.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 36/15 Page 167

Give it enough room to - Yes, I think so.

Houston, ask FAO if the 90-degree bracket isn't stowed in the Commander's stowage assembly.

Yes, he is looking for it now.

02 08 23 47 CC
Roger. We'll have a word for you in just a moment.

02 08 24 28 CDR
Our monitor shows pretty good, clear pictures from this angle. I already found the 90-degree bracket.

02 08 24 37 CC
Roger, Neil. It's really a super picture. We've got the ACA, your ACA, the picture of the throttle, the 90-degree bracket. We see your handles, and now over to the bracket.

02 08 25 25 LMP
That's about the position we'll be putting the camera in after the initial descent on the ladder, and it'll be taken 1 frame a second for most of the EVA.

02 08 25 40 CC
Houston copies. Out. That's a real good view of that camera.

02 08 26 03 LMP
Our monitor is a little bit wavy, so it's hard for us to tell when we're - when we've got a steady picture for you.

02 08 26 11 CC
11, we have no complaints at all. We don't see that waviness on our picture. It's just really great. Over.

02 08 26 19 LMP
Do the edges of the window look like straight lines to you?

02 08 26 22 CC
That's affirmative.

02 08 26 26 LMP
Okay. They don't in our monitor, and that leads us to make some corrections to the camera, which probably aren't required sometimes.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 36/16 Page 168

02 08 26 39 CC
Buzz, we have no complaints at all. It's a magnificent picture.

02 08 27 49 CC
What was that, Buzz, you're chasing now?

02 08 27 55 CDR
That was - That was me picking up some particles of paint that were floating through the air in front of the camera, there.

02 08 28 02 CC
Roger, Neil. We got it. It appears to us that Neil's about to check the Velcro mat, there.

02 08 28 17 CC
Okay, Buzz. We see the card up now.

02 08 28 26 LMP
Okay. For those of you that don't know, this is where we log most of our data for each of the LM maneuvers, and we have another card like this that the timeline book that is laid down on the table in front of the data display keyboard; and it's on this timeline that we have all our procedures. But we obviously have to hold these in place in zero g, so we make use of the Velcro patches on the back and on the table so we can attach these down here; and then we just turn the pages over when we go to new sequences in our timeline of procedures.

02 08 29 13 CC
Roger.

02 08 29 18 LMP
And we're ready to copy DOI PAD.

Roger. We'll have the FIDO's work that one up for you momentarily.

02 08 30 26 CC
11, Houston. That was a good shot of Panel 2. Now we got Panel 3 in view with the TEMP MONITOR switch. The stabilization - station and control panel, we see now, with the MODE CONTROL switches. Now over to the rendezvous radar. Real good.

02 08 30 48 CC
11, that's real good camera work.

02 08 31 06 LMP
That'll be the most unusual position a cameraman's ever had, hanging by his toes from a tunnel and taking the picture upside-down.

02 08 31 17 CC
Roger. Well you're doing a super job. We got a good view of the cross pointer, there. Had a good view of the tape meter.

02 08 31 41 LMP
We're giving you a picture now of the floor of the cabin. I think you can see the - one of the two portable life support system backpacks here in the center, and on each side, we have the two helmet visors. I'll remove one of them and show you a little closer view of what this looks like.

02 08 32 04 CC
Roger.

02 08 32 10 LMP
Inside the helmet visors are the EVA gloves with the blue tips. I'm about to take those out now.

02 08 32 27 CC
Roger, Buzz. That's a great shot now that we're getting of the helmet, the EVA visor, and also the - the EVA gloves in the background.

02 08 32 41 LMP
Okay. You did say this was going out now, didn't you?

02 08 32 45 CC
Standby. I think so.

02 08 32 58 CC
11, you got a pretty big audience. It's live in the U.S. It's going live to Japan, western Europe, and much of South America. Everybody reports very good color. Appreciate the great show.

02 08 33 15 LMP

The traverse from the bottom of the LM to the aft bulkhead of the command module must be about 16, 20 feet. It's not a disorienting one at all, but it's most interesting to contemplate just pushing off from one and bounding on into the other vehicle all the way through the tunnel.

02 08 37 44 CC
Roger. Must be some experience. Is Collins going to go in and look around?

02 08 37 56 CDR
We're willing to let him go but he hasn't come up with the price of the ticket yet.

02 08 38 O1 CC
Roger. I'd advise him to keep his hands off the switches.

02 08 38 08 CDR
If I can get him to keep his hands off my DSKY, it'd be a fair swap.

11, Houston. If that's not the Earth, we're in trouble.

02 08 39 00 CDR
That's the Earth, and we have a very good view of it today. There are a few more cloud bands on than yesterday when we beamed down to you, but it's a beautiful sight.

02 08 39 34 CDR
We have some horizontal banding in our TV monitor. Are we transmitting that to you, or do you have a clear picture?

02 08 39 41 CC
Neil, we have a very clear picture. The only thing that we see is a little white dot in the bottom of our screen, which is - our TV guys say is an - apparently a burned out spot in the camera, but it should come back. Over.

02 08 39 59 CDR
Roger. We have that in our monitor also.

02 08 40 20 CC
11, Houston. We do have three lines across our TV. I thought it was just a transmission problem, but everybody's telling me now that it's probably - it's on the downlink. Over.

11, Houston. We see the - still see the banding along the intratropical convergence. I guess the most predominate one now is around the - up in the - around the equator or slightly north of the equator.

02 08 41 51 LMP
Yes, that's the way it looks, Charlie. Same as yesterday.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Could you give us an idea of about how long it will be before you start close - closing the LM back up? Over.

02 08 46 00 CDR
We've got a little more work to do up here, Charlie. We're going to make sure that we have everything transferred around and stowed the way we want it and try to get a little bit ahead on tomorrow's timeline. I suppose that we could be out of there in another half hour or so if it was necessary.

11, Houston. We were wondering, Neil, with your closing comment on the TV, if you were going to turn it off. It indicated that you might be considering turning it back on. We were wondering whether we want to keep the lines up. Over.

02 09 00 35 CDR
Well, we want your recommendation on that, but I think we would just as soon, ourselves, terminate the TV. But if you have a commitment to keep, we'd be more than willing to turn it back on.

02 10 41 46 CDR
What - What are the updates going to apply to?

02 10 41 51 CC
Roger. We have a couple of changes on the LM mission rules NO GO for your NO GO card, Neil. One slight change on the APS/DPS fuel and TEMP pressure card, and we have a change to the procedure for the secondary radiator leak check, which is to be formed at - performed at 71 hours tomorrow, and also some indications that we have a couple of landing site obliques stowed in the wrong place. Over.

02 10 42 36 CDR
Okay. Is any of those in the flight plan? The secondary radiator, for example?

02 10 42 43 CC
That's affirmative. The secondary radiator leak check is called out in the flight plan at 71 20. That procedure is listed in your launch operations book on page 2 9, L2 9. We'd like to change that procedure. Over.

02 10 43 08 CDR

02 10 43 40 CC
Roger. It's monitor secondary accumulator quantity. Step 2 is secondary glycol to radiator valve, NORMAL for 30 seconds, then BYPASS. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity - Are you with me?

02 10 44 21 CMP
Yes, I'm with you.

02 10 44 22 CC
Okay. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity, secondary glycol to radiator valve to NORMAL. Next step, secondary coolant loop pump,



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 38/3 Page 180

AC 1 or AC 2. After 3 minutes, verify glycol discharge secondary pressure 39 to 51 psig. Also verify secondary EVAP out TEMP has changed. Next step, secondary coolant loop pump, OFF. Secondary glycol to radiator valve, BYPASS. That ends the procedure. Over.

02 10 45 52 CMP
Okay. I read back: monitor secondary accumulator quantity; secondary glycol radiator valve, NORMAL for 30 seconds, then to BYPASS. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity, secondary glycol to radiator valve to NORMAL. Secondary coolant loop pump, AC 1 or 2. After 3 minutes, verify glycol secondary discharge pressure 39 to 51 psig. Verify secondary evaporator outlet TEMP has changed. Secondary coolant loop pump, OFF. Secondary glycol radiator valve to BYPASS. And what's the reason for the change, Charlie?

02 10 46 27 CC
Roger. Stan is concerned that our present procedure as shown in the checklist does not really flow glycol through the radiator, and it - They want to verify that we do not have a plugged secondary radiator. Over.

02 10 46 48 CMP
Okay. They have any abnormal indications in that system, so far?

02 10 46 52 CC
Negative. This is the procedure that they came up with. It's just a check, Mike. Everything's looking great to us. Over.

Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy your update.

02 11 19 35 CC
Roger. Stand by.

02 11 19 50 CC
Okay, Buzz. The first item is that we have indications that your landing site obliques are not in the proper position. If you'll check, we think that the intermediate scale landing site oblique is stowed in the CSM lunar landmark book. We think that the large scale landing site oblique is stowed in the back of the LM lunar surface map book. Over.

02 11 20 38 LMP
I think I heard you Charlie, but I'm not sure that I understand.

02 11 20 45 CC
Roger. According to our stowage list the - the landing site oblique should be in the transfer bag. In - But in the backup set of data, the intermediate scale oblique is in the CSM lunar landmark book, and the large scale oblique is in the back of the LM lunar surface map book; and that's the reason we think that they might be not where you think they are. Over.

02 11 21 15 LMP
Okay. We've got three obliques. The last one is one I asked for recently. It's just a blow up of the second one. The first one is one that's got dotted lines on it, indicating horizon view and 50-degree LPD; and all three of those are in the transfer book. Over.

02 11 21 34 CC
Roger. Fine. We were wrong in our - in our backup set. We had those out of place. Looks like the onboard data's good. We just wanted to let you check on that one. We have an update on the APS/DPS fuel card that you place on the panel. It's a typo error. If you'll break out that little card, we've got the - correct that typo error. Over.

02 11 22 10 LMP
Stand by.

02 11 23 05 LMP
Okay. I got it.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 38/5 Page 182

02 11 23 07 CC
Roger, Buzz. Under the DPS column on the pressure side, you go down to the fourth item, says pressure greater than 150 PTCA should be greater than 65 percent. Over.

02 11 23 28 LMP
Okay. That's greater than 1.8 but less than 65 and greater than 150 for greater than 65.

02 11 23 35 CC
That's affirmative. Out.

02 11 23 46 CC
And we have three items on the mission rules NO-GO card, if you're ready to copy those. Over.

02 11 24 32 LMP
Okay. I've got the mission rules NO-GO.

02 ll 24 34 CC
Roger, Buzz. First entry's on the EPS under AC bus A. The line extends all the way to high gate. Actually, the line should read - at DOI it would be NO-GO AC bus A. After that the NO-GO would be both buses. So if you will just pencil in both buses from PDI through high gate, it'll be correct for that line. Over.

02 11 25 20 LMP
Okay. I've got that: AC bus A for DOI and both buses NO-GO for PDI on.

02 11 25 28 CC
That's affirmative up until high gate. You can stop at the line in front of the column "5 minutes to low gate". Now the next line is under the G&C PGNS, pitch and roll GDA's. You can scratch that line completely. Over.

02 11 25 56 LMP
Roger. Got it.

02 11 25 57 CC
Okay, Buzz. Last entry is down under RCS, and it's a typo error under the three - in the line "three axis attitude control". If you proceed to the right at PDI plus 05, you'll see one axis. The line goes all the way to low gate to touchdown. That's incorrect. The line should stop under "5 minutes to low gate". Over.

02 11 26 38 LMP
Okay. We're stopping that at "5 minutes to low gate".

02 11 26 41 CC
That's affirmative. That completes that card. The rest of the updates are just really for your information based on our 58 hour platform - look at the platform. We are really good shape. Your GYRO's have almost no drift in them since - plotted update we were looking at X of a minus 2.24 ...



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 38/6 Page 183

Y of point plus 0.87, Z of minus 0.11. Since the update, which was based on the 52 hour P52, I believe, we gave you an X drift of plus 0.79, yaw of plus 1.06, Z of plus 0.02 ... I can see the difference between the 52 hour and the 57 hour alignments were - did not really give us enough time to get a real good or completely valid update on the drift check. So we're real satisfied with the way the GYRO's are looking. The PIPA's are looking great also. We are in real good shape with those, too. Over.

This is Apollo 11. Radio check.

02 11 32 23 CC
Roger. Reading you five by. How me? Over.

02 11 32 28 CDR
Okay. Loud and clear. You cut out when you were talking about the platform - something about 52 hours and after that, we never heard you again.

02 11 32 37 CC
Roger. Guess we were changing antennas. Stand by. That's affirmative, 11. We were swapping antennas on you down here. Basically the word is that we have a real good platform, very small drift on the GYRO's, and very small drift in the PIPA's. Over.

02 11 33 00 CDR
Roger. Thank you. And I would like to have a few words of clarification if you will give them to me on the RCS ... what that change of pitch may mean.

02 11 33 14 CC
Copy. A few words of clarification on the RCS? Oh. Roger. The update there, Neil, you are speaking of about the one axis down to 5 minutes of low gate?

02 11 33 31 CDR
Yes. That's right. I'm not quite sure what that ... means beyond 5 minutes.

02 11 33 38 CC
Stand by. I'll make sure I got my story straight with Control. Stand by.

02 11 33 44 CDR
Okay.

02 11 34 33 CC
11, Houston. On the RCS, what we are saying is that if we lose control about one axis prior to low gate, we would recommend an abort. This would require a - a loss of - of two distinct jets which is not very probable, but that is what we are recommending. After low gate we would continue on. We would recommend that we continue on to attempt a landing. Over.

02 11 36 37 CC
11, Houston. Did you copy that transmission?

02 11 37 09 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We swapped antennas on you again. I say again that we do not have any lunar surface update - book updates at this time. We're considering a few minor ones, but we're still kicking them around the MOCR. Over.

02 11 50 16 CC
Roger. Thank you, Mike. Could you give us some help? This PTC is strange: it's not like anything we've seen before. We were wondering if you have had any events or any odd data that could help us out. Over.

02 11 50 35 CMP
I didn't understand that. Say again.

02 11 50 38 CC
Roger. We're looking at a - sort of a funny looking PTC. We've already drifted out to 70 degrees in pitch and we're wondering if you all have had any vents or any such thing as that, that could have caused us to pick up these rates to drive us off. Over.

Unless it's got something to do with that entry from the position that we want to be in. I don't know.

02 11 51 21 CC
Roger. When we started off, it looked real fine to us. Now it's drifting off with a funny pattern that we haven't seen previously on a flight. And we're just trying to figure out - I think we'll probably start it over again. We'll be with you momentarily. Over.

02 11 51 39 CMP
Okay.

02 11 55 12 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We hate to say it, but we'd like to terminate this PTC and start over again. We have no assurance that we're going to get it through the sleep period with this funny configuration, or funny pattern.

02 12 50 42 CC
We have absolutely no idea. Over.

02 12 50 49 CMP
Okay. Did, it look like it was all right, then just all of a sudden start diverging?

02 12 50 57 CC
That's negative, Mike. If you'll look at the plot, which we'll save for you and let you see it postflight, it started off immediately on the first REV and just spiraled out to about - oh 20 to - 20 degrees in pitch, and then it seemed to be setting up a spiral around an offset pitch point of about 20 degrees off from 90 degrees; but we didn't want to take a chance that it would become stable at that point. We thought it might diverge, and so we called you and started over again. Over.

02 12 51 39 CMP
Okay, no complaints. I was just curious as to what had happened.

02 23 03 48 LMP
Would you like the O2 purge this morning?

02 23 03 52 CC
Yes indeed. O2 fuel cell purge at 71 hours, and when you feel like copying, I've got a flight plan update containing - I guess that and some other items for you.

02 23 04 08 CDR
Okay. Stand by.

02 23 06 59 LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead with the flight plan update.

02 23 07 05 CC
Roger, 11. This is Houston. At approximately 71 hours to 72 hours, we have you down for an eat period which I imagine is probably in progress already. 71 hours: O2 fuel cell purge; 72 hours GET: CO2 filter change number 6, secondary radiator flow check. And we'll send you up a P37 block data on a 2 hour pass, pericynthion pass, return mode abort. At 73 hours 00 minutes: stop PTC at approximately 0 degrees roll. That is, when you're ccming up on 0 degrees roll angle around 73 hours, we'd like you to stop PTC. And perform a P52 option 3 remaining in the PTC REFSMMAT for a drift check. 73 hours, 20 minutes: we'll give you a P27 update to the landing site REFSMMAT, LOI 1 state vector, and target load. 73 hours 30 minutes: maneuver to 000 roll, pitch, and yaw; high gain antenna angles will be pitch 0, yaw 335; and perform a P52 option 1 using the new landing site REFSMMAT. Resume the nominal flight plan at 74 hours GET. Over.

02 23 09 08 LMP
Okay. We'll get started on the fuel cell purge while we're eating. CO2 canister change number 6; secondary radiator flow check; copy some pads. Also at 72 hours, stop PTC 0 roll at 73; do a P52 option 3; we'll get your uplink REFSMMAT for the landing site; and at 000 - let's see, now was this with the old REFSMMAT or the new REFSMMAT?

02 23 24 14 LMP
Okay. We're ready to listen.

02 23 24 18 CC
Okay, 11. It turns out that the engine performance during both of your burns so far this mission has been the same as it was on engine acceptance tests. The onboard PC reading is due to a known gage calibration factor between what you've actually got in the chamber and what you're reading out on the gage. We expect single bank operation to be 90 - that is, 90 psi on the gage with an actual chamber pressure of 95 psi. In dual bank operation, the chamber pressure is 94 psi on the gage with an actual of 99 psi. 80 psi on the gage on board correlates to 83 psi actual. And we recommend that you stick to an LOI termination cue of 80 psi on the gage. That is, no change to the mission rules. Over.

02 23 25 37 CDR

Roger, 11. We're reading you loud and clear now. We were down in the noise as we switched antennas a minute or so ago. Over.

02 23 34 00 CMP
Roger. What sort of settings could you recommend for the solar corona? We've got the Sun right behind the edge of the Moon now.

02 23 34 12 CC
Roger.

02 23 34 16 LMP
It's quite an erie sight. There is a very marked three dimensional aspect of having the Sun's corona coming from behind the Moon the way it is.

02 23 34 27 CC
Roger.

02 23 34 31 LMP
And it looks as though - I guess what's giving it that three dimensional effect is the earthshine. I can see Tycho fairly clearly - at least if I'm right side up, I believe it's Tycho, in moonshine - I mean, in earthshine. And, of course, I can see the sky is lit all the way around the Moon, even on the limb of it where there's no earthshine or sunshine.

02 23 35 40 CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.

02 23 35 45 LMP
Go ahead.

02 23 35 47 CC
Roger. If you'd like to take some pictures, we recommend using magazine Uniform which is loaded with high speed black and white film, interior lights off, electric Hasselblad with the 80 millimeter lens. And you're going to have to hand hold us, I guess. We're recommending an f stop of 2.8, and we'd like to get a sequence of time exposures. Over.

02 23 36 24 LMP
Okay. You want magazine Uniform instead of magazine Tango? Over.

02 23 36 30 CC
Roger. We're not trying to get you all wrapped up in a procedure here. This is on a not to interfere basis, of course. Over.

02 23 36 43 LMP
Okay.

02 23 36 46 CC
And on the exposures we're looking for an eighth of a second, a half a second. And, if you think you can steady the camera against anything to get longer exposures, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, and 8 seconds. Over.

02 23 52 24 CC
Oh, very good.

02 23 56 00 CDR
And, Houston, I'd suggest that along the ecliptic line we can see the corona light out to two lunar diameters from this location. The bright light only extends out about an eighth to a quarter of the lunar radius.

02 23 56 35 CC
Roger. Understand that you can see the corona approximately 200 solar diameters out along the ecliptic, and the bright light extends out approximately one eighth to one quarter lunar radius. Over.

02 23 56 52 CDR
That's two lunar - two lunar diameters along the ecliptic in the bright part, right; a quarter to an eighth of a lunar radius out, and that's perpendicular to the ecliptic line on the South Pole.

02 23 57 07 CC
Roger.

02 23 59 20 CDR
Houston, it's been a real change for us. Now we are able to see stars again and recognize constellations for the first time on the trip. It's - the sky is full of stars. Just like the nightside of Earth. But all the way here, we have only been able to see stars occasionally and perhaps through the monocular, but not recognize any star patterns.

02 23 59 52 CC
I guess it has turned into night up there really, hasn't it ?

Okay. We went to HIGH GAIN. Looks like you had a little trouble getting signal strength there.

03 00 14 49 CC
Roger. We missed an 0MNI switch there. Over.

03 00 14 55 CDR
All right. On the secondary loop check when we went to FLOW on the secondary radiators, the quantity dropped from 40 percent down to 36 in the first 10 seconds and then stabilized at 36 for the remainder of the 30 seconds.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 46/7 Page 202

03 00 15 30 CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We believe that is normal system operation. The radiators are expected to be very cold right now and apparently the decrease you saw was due to contraction in the fluid. Over.

03 00 15 49 CDR
Okay. We will go ahead with the procedure just as if there were no decrease in accumulator quantity. Right?

You might be interested in knowing, since you are already on the way, that a Houston astrologer, Ruby Graham, says that all the signs are right for your trip to the Moon. She says that Neil is clever, Mike has good judgment, and Buzz can work out intricate problems. She also says Neil tends to see the world through rose colored glasses, but he is always ready to help the afflicted or distressed. Neil, you are also suppose to have "intuition that enables you to interpret life with feeling." Buzz is to be very sociable and cannot bear to be alone in addition to having excellent critical ability. Since she didn't know at what hour Mike was born, she has decided that he either has the same attributes as Neil or he is inventive with an unconventional attitude that might seem eccentric to the unimaginative.

Apollo 11 is getting its first view of the landing approach. This time we are going over the Taruntius crater, and the pictures and maps brought back by Apollo 8 and 10 have given us a very good preview of what to look at here. It looks very much like the pictures, but like the difference between watching a real football game and watching it on TV. There's no substitute for actually being here.

No, that's fine. I just wanted to confirm that. Until 79 10, then we'll breeze around here in orbit.

03 04 57 07 CC
Roger. And we've got an observation you can make if you have some time up there. There's been some lunar transient events reported in the vicinity of Aristarchus. Over.

03 04 57 28 LMP
Roger. We just went into spacecraft darkness. Until then, why, we couldn't see a thing down below us. But now, with earthshine, the visibility is pretty fair. Looking back behind me, now, I can see the corona from where the Sun has just set. And we'll get out the map and see what we can find around Aristarchus

We're coming upon Aristarchus right now - -

03 04 57 55 CC

However, at your present altitude, which is about 167 nautical miles, it ought to be over - that is within view of your horizon: 23 degrees north, 47 west. Take a look and see if you see anything worth noting up there. Over.

Both looking.

03 05 03 09 CC
Say again, please, 11.

03 05 03 23 LMP
You might give us a time of crossing of 45 west, and then we'll know when to start searching for Aristarchus.

03 05 03 32 CC

become visible over your horizon. 77 12 is point of closest approach south of it. Over.

03 05 12 06 LMP
Roger. Seems to me since we know orbits so precisely, and know where the stars are so precisely, and the time of setting of a star or a planet to so very fine a degree, that this might be a pretty good means of measuring the altitude of the horizon ...

03 05 12 32 CC
Roger.

03 05 12 51 CMP
Hey, Houston. I'm looking north up toward Aristarchus now, and I can't really tell at that distance whether I am really looking at Aristarchus, but there's an area that is considerably more illuminated than the surrounding area. It just has - seems to have a slight amount of fluorescence to it. A crater can be seen, and the area around the crater is quite bright.

03 05 13 30 CC
Roger, 11. We copy.

03 05 14 23 LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Looking up at the same area now and it does seem to be reflecting some of the earthshine. I'm not sure whether it was worked



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 50/3 Page 224

out to be about zero phase to - Well, at least there is one wall of the crater that seems to be more illuminated than the others, and that one - if we are lining up with the Earth correctly, does seem to put it about at zero phase. That area is definitely lighter than anything else that I could see out this window. I am not sure that I am really identifying any phosphorescence, but that definitely is lighter than anything else in the neighborhood.

03 05 15 15 CC
11, this is Houston. Can you discern any difference in color of the illumination, and is that an inner or an outer wall from the crater? Over.

03 05 15 34 CMP
Roger. That's an inner wall of the crater.

03 05 15 43 LMP
No, there doesn't appear to be any color involved in it, Bruce.

03 05 15 47 CC
Roger. You said inner wall. Would that be the inner edge of the northern surface?

03 05 16 00 CMP
I guess it would be the inner edge of the westnorthwest part, the part that would be more nearly normal if you were looking at it from the Earth.

03 05 16 20 CC
11, Houston. Have you used the monocular on this? Over.

11, Houston. In order to improve the communications a little bit here, we'd like to try to get you on the high gain antenna. We're recommending a pitch angle of 0, yaw 355 - I say again 355, the track switch to MANUAL, and wide beamwidth. Over.

03 05 32 42 CDR
Okay. You ready to switch to high gain now?

That's affirmative.

Houston, Apollo 11. One of the larger craters on the back side - I noticed a small, dark speck on the outer wall and I put the monocular on it. I was able to see - oh, an area maybe a quarter of a mile in diameter. It was really a freshlooking dark colored pit, and that seems to be in contrast with all the other fresh little craters or holes that you can perceive on the walls of any of these craters. Around this particular one there seems to be two or three of these - especially the one that caught my attention. Quite remarkable. Over.

03 06 26 24 CC
Roger. Do you have a location on that one?

03 06 26 34 LMP
No, not a precise one. I've got several pictures of it, though.

03 06 26 38 CC
Roger. We copy.

03 06 26 47 CC
We're getting a beautiful picture in down there now, 11. The color's coming in quite clearly, and we can see the horizon and the relative blackness of space, and without getting into the question of grays and browns, it looks, at least on our monitor, sort of a brownish gray.

03 06 27 10 LMP
That's a good, reasonable way of describing it. It appears to me as though it made a difference just sitting back in the tunnel and gazing at all windows; it makes a difference which one you're looking out of. For example, the camera



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 50/7 Page 228

right now is looking out the number 5 window, and it definitely gives a rosier or tanner tinge, especially when you look straight through it and not at an angle. Over.

Houston, Apollo 11. Could you observe a difference in the N2 pressures before LOI? It seems to me as though the two were not equal on the ... B tank was a little low on pressure. Over.

03 06 28 57 CMP
I'm flying it in SPS minimum impulse, Houston, and it's rather difficult to keep it on a constant data. The LM wants to wander up and down. I'm not sure if it's in response to MASCONN's or what, but I can get it completely stabilized in DATA and let it alone, and in another couple of minutes it will have developed its own rate.

This is Houston. Roger.

Okay, Houston. Several minutes ago I was exactly steady on data, and since then I have been moving

03 06 34 50 CC
Roger.

03 06 34 55 CC
And we show you at an altitude now of about 110 miles; and, of course, you'll be considerably lower at the initiation of powered descent.

Okay, Houston. Look at register 3 on the DSKY data. This data is increasing toward my desired of 315; and I'll let the hand controller alone here, and I'll bet you it reverses itself.

03 06 35 46 CC
Roger, 11. We're watching the DSKY now, and it's still coming in beautifully on the TV.

03 06 35 59 LMP
Okay. There's - on the right side of the screen at the present time, there's a triple crater with - with a small crater between the first and second; and the one at the bottom of the screen is Schubert Y. Zoom in; it does have a central peak in Schubert Y. Actually, several of them, and you can observe those plus the rim craters at the bottom of your screen.

03 06 36 36 CC
Roger. We're seeing the central peak quite clearly now.

03 06 36 53 LMP
Okay. We're zooming in now on a crater called Schubert N. Schubert N, very conical inside walls and the bottom appears to be nearly flat.

03 06 37 11 CMP
Look at data on the DSKY. It's stabilized and is holding steady now.

03 06 37 19 CC
Roger.

03 06 37 20 LMP
Looking out the window I can see a number of small craters on the bottom of Schubert N.

03 06 37 32 CMP
We're coming up on the Foaming Sea where I'll be doing some P22 marking on a crater of my choice, name of crater, Camp.

03 06 37 41 CC
Okay. We'll be watching for Neper.

03 06 37 49 CMP
And notice register 3 has reversed itself, and it's heading back the other way now without any pitch thruster firing.

03 06 37 56 CC
Roger, Mike. We confirm that you've changed the direction of your pitch rate.

03 06 38 28 CMP
Generally speaking - -

03 06 38 30 LMP
The crater - -

03 06 38 31 CMP
- - The tendency seems to be to pull the LM down toward the center of the Moon there as in a gravity gradient experiment.

It may have something to do with MASSCON's or it may just be the peculiarity of the DSKY display.

03 06 38 51 CC
Okay. We've observed the behavior of your DSKY, and I think we've got the data here to work on it. Let us grind around a little while on it, and we'll report back to you, probably in a REV or two.

03 06 39 08 CMP
Okay. Well, in the meantime, I'm going to pitch down toward 315.

03 06 39 14 CC
Roger.

03 06 39 25 LMP
Three craters - three horizontal craters that you now have in the field of view are immediately underneath the ground track. The right hand is the largest crater that you see, Dubiago P.

03 06 39 49 CC
Roger. We concur on the identification of that crater.

03 06 40 01 CC
And we show you coming up on landmark Alfa 1 here shortly.

03 06 40 11 LMP
Roger. Mike's having his first look at Alfa 1 at the present time.

03 06 40 22 CMP
Yea. It's a very bright crater. It's not a large one but an extremely bright one. It looks like a very recent and, I would guess, impact crater with rays streaming out in all directions which should make my - Correction - the Foaming Sea easy to see coming up on it now. Crater Camp is one of the smaller ones out on the - on the floor of the Foaming Sea.

03 06 41 34 CC
Here we show you over the Sea of Fertility now, and we ought to have Langrenus down south of track a few degrees, about 9 degrees south of track.

03 06 41 48 LMP
Now the crater that's in the center of the screen now is Webb. We'd be looking straight down on it at about 6 minutes before power descent. It has a relatively flat bottom to the crater, and you can see maybe two or three craters that are in the bottom of it on the western wall, the wall that's now nearest the - the camera. Near the bottom of the screen, we can see a dimple crater, just on the outside. And then coming back toward the bottom of the screen and to the left, you can see a series of depressions. It's this type of connected craters that give us most interest to discover why they're in the particular pattern that they're in. I'll zoom the camera in now and try and give you a closer look at it.

03 06 42 48 CC
Roger. We're observing the dimple crater now. The central peak we can see on the Orbiter photos doesn't seem to stand out very well here.

03 06 43 02 LMP
Well, they're not central peaks. They're depressions in the center.

03 06 43 05 CC
Roger.

03 06 43 08 CMP
And you'll notice on the pitch thruster activity, I've still - I've put in a dozen mininum impulses in pitchdown, and I'm still far from correcting back to 315.

03 06 43 20 LMP
We're moving the camera over to the right window now to give you Langrenus, its - its several central peaks and -

03 06 43 29 CC
Roger. We got Langrenus in our screen now.

03 06 43 54 CC
Okay, 11. This is Houston. We're getting a beautiful picture of Langrenus now with its rather conspicuous central peak.

03 06 44 07 CMP
The Sea of Fertility doesn't look very fertile to me. I don't know who named it.

03 06 44 12 CDR
Well, it may have been named by a gentleman whom this crater was named after, Langrenus. Langrenus was a cartographer to the King of Spain and made one of the - one of the early reasonably accurate maps of the Moon.

03 06 44 39 CC
Roger. That's very interesting - -

... at least it sounds better for our purposes than the Sea of Crises.

03 06 44 46 CC
Amen to that.

03 06 44 52 CC
Okay. It looks like you're coming inside now on the camera.

03 06 44 59 LMP
Well, I can't get behind to see the monitor. I'll bring the focus in, but we're going to be looking down past one of the LM quads and one of the antennas almost straight down at the ground track that we'll be seeing coming in now. I guess there's maybe 2 or 3 minutes before power descent.

03 06 45 37 LMP
All right, that should put the LM structure about in focus, and I'm going to move it out to infinity and then expand the field of view.

03 06 46 00 LMP
Crater Secchi is out my window now, window number 2.

03 06 46 09 CC
Hello, Apollo 11. This is Houston. We show you coming up on the terminator at 78 53, about 7 minutes from now, and we've also got the LOI 2 and TEI 5 PAD's ready for you after the TV whenever you want to terminate. Over.

05 06 46 31 LMP
Roger.

03 06 46 33 CC
And we're getting a good view of the track leading into the landing site now and -

03 06 46 58 CC
Okay, And it looks like we got Secchi K, went by about 10 seconds ago; coming up on Apollo Ridge.

03 06 47 36 CC
And in the right hand portion of our screen right now, we can see Messier Alfa and Bravo with the light colored rays streaming off in one direction.

03 06 48 00 LMP
I don't know if you can make out, but in the Sea of Fertility there are a number of craters that are just barely discernible, old, old craters whose outlines are just barely able to be seen.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 51/6 Page 235

03 06 48 14 CC
Roger. I think we can make them out. The color really enhances our ability to discern features and craters over what we see in real time on our black and white monitor.

03 06 48 31 LMP
Right. The - At these low Sun angles, there's no trace of brown, it's now returned to a very gray appearance and, like the 8 crew says, it has a look of plaster of paris to it at this Sun angle, which is completely lacking in ...

03 06 48 49 CC
Roger.

03 06 49 06 LMP
Okay. This is very close to ignition point for power descent. Just passing Mount Marilyn that - that triangular shaped mountain that you see in the center of the screen at the present time with crater Secchi Theta on top of the far northern edge of the mountain.

03 06 49 32 CC
Roger. We're getting a good view of Mount Marilyn and the Secchi Theta.

03 06 49 45 LMP
And now we're looking at what we call Boot Hill; occurs 20 seconds into the descent.

03 06 50 08 LMP
The bright, sharp rimmed crater at the very right edge of the screen, Censorinus T. Now passing the - the 1 minute point in power descent.

03 06 50 30 CC
Roger. And for your information, your current altitude is 148 nautical miles above the surface.

03 06 50 39 LMP
Don't you think?

03 06 50 43 CMP
I'm unable to determine altitude at all looking out the window. I couldn't tell whether we were down at 60 or up at 170.

03 06 50 50 CC
I bet you could tell if you were down at 50,000 feet.

03 06 50 57 CMP
I wouldn't be surprised.

03 06 51 11 LMP
We're passing some steep ridges here. The edge of some old craters that were photographed by Apollo 10; and those - the crew of Apollo 10 was very impressed with the steepness of these ridges when they came over them at about 50,000 feet.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 51/7 Page 236

03 06 51 36 CC
Roger. We can observe they're also steep even from this altitude. You got quite a shadow being cast by the Sun at these low angles.

03 06 51 47 LMP
The entire surface is getting considerably darker than the surface that we looked at previously when the Sun was quite high above us. The crater in the - bright crater in the center of the screen, - well, the smaller one is Censorinus.

03 06 52 09 CC
Roger. And we show you low over 1 minute from the terminator at the present time.

03 06 52 24 LMP
How's the brightness of the picture you're receiving? You think we ought to open f stop some as we approach the terminator?

03 06 52 34 CC
Yes. The brightness is still doing quite well. You can go ahead and open it up a stop or two. The automatic light level compensation seems to be working beautifully.

03 06 52 58 LMP
There's a good picture of Boot Hill.

03 06 53 02 CC
Roger. We're - -

03 06 53 03 LMP
Three minutes and 15 seconds into the descent.

03 06 53 08 CC
Roger. We're seeing Boot Hill now.

03 06 53 10 LMP
The next crater coming into the bottom, that's Duke Island right there, and to the left, the crater - the largest of the craters near the center of the picture right now is Maskelyne W. This is a position check during descent at about 3 minutes and 39 seconds, and it's our down range position check and cross range position check prior to yawing over face up to acquire the landing radar. Past this point, we would be unable to see the surface below us until getting very near the landing area.

03 06 53 57 CC
Roger. I imagine you'll get a - you'll get a real good look at that tomorrow afternoon.

03 06 54 14 LMP
Sinuous Rille is the one that was referred to in Apollo 10 as Sidewinder.

03 06 54 21 CMP
That's a good name, too: Sidewinder and Diamondback. It looks like a couple of snakes down there in a lake bed.

03 06 54 49 LMP
Contrast has increased and only the sunlit side of these ridges remain illuminated, while the dark sides and the shadow will become completely black.

03 06 54 59 CC
11, this is Houston. The picture's getting a little grainy now. You might go ahead and open up the f stop.

03 06 55 19 LMP
Landing point is just barely in the darkness. That one crater, the upper part of which you see, lower part completely in darkness. The small, well defined crater is Moltke, which is about abeam of the landing sight.

03 06 55 32 CC
Roger. We can just see; it looks like a little less than half of its rim right now.

03 06 55 45 CC
And we can make out just barely some features on the surface, maybe from earthshine.

03 06 55 58 CC
Are you wide open on the f stop at this time?

03 06 56 03 CMP
Yes, we are.

03 06 56 06 LMP
Yes. And it looks like we're just about to get the Sun coming into the lens, so we'll have to move the camera away.

03 06 56 12 CC
Roger.

03 06 56 14 CMP
We can't see any earthshine or any surface features at all in earthshine now due to the fact that the LM is very bright and is causing our pupils to contract. It's a very fantastic view to see the terminator as you look along the edge of it. I think you'll agree that some of these craters that you're seeing in the picture now are really accentuated by the lengthening of the shadows as they come close to the terminator.

03 06 56 42 CC
Yes. It's a very beautiful and a rugged sight that we've got on the screen now.

03 06 56 52 CMP
And I think you've got some interesting data on thruster firing versus pitch angle. It looks



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 51/9 Page 238

like that LM just wants to head down towards the surface, is all.

03 06 57 01 CC
Roger. I have a comment here that says that's what the LM was built for.

03 06 57 12 CMP
I believe!

And as the Moon sinks slowly in the west, Apollo 11 bids good day to you.

03 06 57 50 CC

Remarks: On your DAP load, we would like an R1 20101 vice the value which appears in the flight plan. In making the sextant star check this must be done between GET of 79 30 10, at which time the star comes above the horizon, and 79 52 10, which is your local sunrise due to the fact that this star's relatively close to the Sun. Your burn orientation is heads down, retrograde pitched up 28 degress with respect to local horizontal. The calculated values for NOUN 42 are HA 65.6 and HP 54.6. Both of those being plus. Read back.

I get the distinct impression, Charlie, that mare there laps up over the edge of the mountains at the shorelines.

Roger. We copy.

03 08 56 40 CC
Houston. On your comment about the mare lapping up to the terrain - mountainous terrain, is that an impression like a lava flow coming in around a prominence, Neil, or is it more -looks like it's sloping up at that point? Over.

03 08 57 06 CDR
It isn't true everywhere, but there's certainly places where there seems to be a slope downward towards the shoreline on the mare. In other words, from the mare down to the shoreline is a downward slope indicating that it might be a lava flow.

All that procedure for P22 seemed to work very well. The only thing that was a little odd, is that there was some DAP thruster activity. I had pitch in ACCEL COMMAND, and roll and yaw in RATE COMMAND, and somehow, roll and yaw got excited and the DAP went into a flurry of thruster firing. We've noticed the same thing in the CMS, and just written it off as a CMS peculiarity.

03 12 31 29 CMP
Go ahead. Over.

03 12 31 40 CC
Okay, 11. First of all, on our LM systems checks, everything went fine. I would like to remind you, though, tomorrow you may see an ascent pressure light when you activate the MC&W. There should be no problem, however. You did note that the APS AUX tank pressure was only reading 111 psi, which is normal at this point, but below the level which will trigger your light due to the helium which has been dissolved into the propellant. Over.

03 12 32 18 CMP
Roger. Understand that. Thank you.

03 12 32 20 CC
Roger. And next item, the supercritical helium rise rate is nominal, and you also had that question for us about your thruster activity during the P22 on the last REV. Believe we understand that now, as you reported that your pitch was in ACCEL COMMAND and your yaw and roll were in RATE COMMAND. You were firing your pitch thrusters. This will couple rates into your yaw and roll axes, and the - You were at that time holding only half a degree deadband and coupling rates into yaw and roll produced the extra firings about the yaw and roll axes. Over.

03 12 33 07 CMP
Yes. That may be true. It's very peculiar coupling, in that it waits longer than you would think and its reaction is greater than you would think. We were getting yaw rates of around four tenths of a degree per second, for example.

03 12 33 23 CC
Roger, Mike. We did play the data back, and that's the way it looked upon analysis of the chart recordings back here. Over.

The marks all apparently were very good, and we've got a full page of data here relative to the altitudes of the various site locations, which I won't read up to you, but I did want to let you know that the marks apparently went very well. I also have your consumable budgets, particularly your RCS propellant quantities. They're Deltas from nominal if you should want them. Your worst quad is quad Charlie, which is 9 percent low. I'll not read up the others unless you want them. Over.

03 12 34 17 CMP
Okay. How about the O2 fuel cell purge? You want that now?

03 12 34 22 CC

Okay. I have O2 tank heater 1 off, and H2 tank heater 2 off.

That's right, Mike, and we believe you have your quad Bravo and quad Charlie turned off in your DAP at this time, and a 5 degree deadband. We'd prefer a 10 degree deadband for your sleep period overnight here. Over.

One other item relative to a malfunction procedure. It's unlikely that you'll have to worry about this

tomorrow, but in your malfunction list under docking on page F11 9, there is a malfunction procedure for a high O2 flow rate at the top of - under tunnel at the top of page 11 9. We would like to have you not use that malfunction procedure should you encounter the high O2 flow rate, and instead, check back with Houston for a revised procedure should you find that situation. Over.

03 12 37 38 CMP
Understand, and note has been made in my checklist.

03 12 37 45 CC

Apollo 11, Houston. We're still unable to pick you up on the high gain antenna. Request you go to MANUAL, and wide beamwidth. The pitch and yaw angles in your checklist are good ones. You should be able to find us there. Over.

Roger. That's all we want. We want to stay in narrow, and we're a little puzzled about why we lost you here a few minutes ago. Do you have any ideas?

03 12 53 48 LMP
No, we sure don't (cough) - sure don't. We're showing - we're showing about 15 degrees plus pitch and about 270. That ought to be good and clear.

03 12 54 00 CC
We concur there. We still don't have any good ideas on why we were lost then.

03 12 54 38 CC

11, Houston. On your AUTO RCS SELECT switches, we show quad Bravo disabled but quad Charlie only partially disabled. Charlie 3, I believe, is the only one you have selected off. Is that correct?

03 13 05 05 CMP
Yes. Roger. That's correct.

Apollo 11, Houston. Over.

03 13 09 30 LMP
Go ahead, Houston.

03 13 09 31 CC
11, Houston. We're going to try to check out this ability to automatically reacquire on the S band, and what we want to do is to secure our uplink carrier for about 30 seconds. Then we will turn it back on and see if the spacecraft equipment will automatically reacquire. So if you do not get a call from us within about 3 minutes, that means we have not been able to reacquire and request your assistance on a manual acquisition. Over.

03 13 10 04 LMP
Okay. We understand.

03 13 10 11 CC
11, Houston. We also would appreciate - if you will note the angles that the antenna tracks through in its attempt to reacquire. Over.

03 13 10 26 LMP
Roger. We'll do that.

03 13 13 28 CC
11, Houston. It looks like we're locked back up again with no delay. How does it look on board? Over.

03 13 13 37 LMP
Roger. The signal strength dropped very rapidly to zero; and the pitch and yaw, in about 3 secconds, moved toward 40 degrees pitch and 240 degrees yaw. Right now, they're sitting on about 15 degrees pitch and about 265 degrees yaw. So they didn't move very far, about 30 degrees apiece; and then they picked right back on up again. Over.

03 13 14 19 CC
Roger. Some of "The Luckiest People" in the background there. We copied your pitch and yaw angles.

03 13 15 27 CC
11, Houston. Could you give us the location of your - pitch and yaw location of your position indicators? Over.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 55/3 Page 261

03 13 15 39 LMP
Roger. They're in the same position as the antenna right now; plus 15 degrees pitch and - no, now wait a minute. I got them - got it at about 275 instead of 265.

03 13 15 57 CC
Okay. Thank you.

03 13 16 23 CC
11, Houston. We'd like to try the same procedure once more. We'll leave the carrier a little longer and be back up for a call within 4 minutes. Over.

03 13 16 35 LMP
Okay.

03 13 20 07 CC
11, Houston. We're locked back up again. Can you give us a report on how the antenna behaved?

03 13 20 24 LMP
Roger. It was essentially identical as before. The pitch went to 45, 40 to 45 and the yaw went to about - to about 255, 245 to 255; and then it rather quickly locked up at 15 degrees pitch and 270 yaw. Over.

03 13 20 49 CC
11, Houston. Roger. Your angles are 45 and 255. Do I understand that as soon as the carrier dropped, it went to these angles; or did it only go to these angles after the uplink carrier was reenabled and the antenna began to reacquire? Over.

03 13 21 12 LMP
No. As soon as the carrier dropped off, why, it drifted over into those angles and stayed there. Then when it came back up again, why, it hunted around for a while, but it didn't get any further off. Gradually brought it on in to the angles where it is right now; and then the signal strength would take several jumps as evidently it goes from wide to medium to narrow. Over.

03 13 21 38 CC
11, Houston. Understand. And on another subject, request you zero your optics for the night. Over.

03 13 21 58 LMP
Roger. Zeroed.

03 13 27 46 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Can you confirm that you have changed the CO2 filter as per flight plan in the last hour? Over?

Roger, 11. And we've got about 14 minutes until LOS. A0S is 86 30, an hour away. We're wondering whether or not you plan to have one man up at that time or would you all like to be asleep inside the next hour? Over.

03 13 28 25 CMP
Somebody will be up.

03 13 28 27 CC
Roger. The thing that we're still puzzling on is the antenna, and if - as long as there will be somebody up, why, we would like to have somebody check the automatic REACQ on the next AOS.

03 13 28 42 CMP
Okay. We'll do that. We haven't chlorinated the water yet, and we haven't changed the lithium hydroxide. We're just still finishing up dinner.

03 13 28 49 CC
Roger, Mike. Thank you.

03 13 40 07 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We have LOS coming up in 2 minutes now, and A0S will be at 86 plus 28 plus 15. Over.

Okay. We just appeared to get a solid lock for the last - oh, about a minute.

No one is predicting who will be first pitcher for the National League yet. They have nine on the roster. Even though research has certainly paid off in the space program, research doesn't always pay off, it seems. The Woodstream Corporation, parent company of the Animal Trap Company of America which has made more than a billion wooden spring mousetraps, reports that it built a better mousetrap but the world didn't beat a door to its path - didn't beat a path to its door.

You're loud and clear. The waste water dump is down to 10 percent. I have a question on the P22. Do you want me to do another P22, or is all that information just for my own use in tracking the LM for photographic purposes?

04 10 11 49 CC
Columbia, this is Houston. We request that you perform another P22. We'd like you to let the AUTO optics take care of the tracking and devote your energies to trying to pick out the LM on the lunar surface. If you can find the LM, of course. We're looking for marks on it; but tracking of geographical features doesn't do us all that much good. Over.

04 10 12 18 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. Fine. I'll do it. And on the ECS system, the - Whatever the problem was, it seems to have gone away without any changing of J52 sensors or anything like that. My glycol evaporator outlet TEMP is up above 50 now, and it's quite comfortable in the cockpit; so we'll talk more about that one later.

Columbia, Houston. Another possibility is the southern rim of the southern of the two oldlooking craters. Over.

04 10 38 42 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger, Houston. Columbia ... I kept my eyes glued to the sextant that time hoping I'd get a flash of reflected light off the LM, but I wasn't able to see any of my scan areas that you suggested.

04 10 38 56 CC
Roger. On that southern of the old craters, there's a small bright crater on the southern rim. One plot would put him slightly to the west of that small bright crater, about 500 to 1000 feet. Do you see anything down there? Over.

04 10 39 19 CMP (COLUMBIA)

04 10 44 03 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. Understand. I was looking where auto optics was tracking, on the average, and understand that it should have been more to the north and more to the west; actually a tiny bit outside the circle, huh?

04 10 44 17 CC
More to the north and a little more to the east. The feature that I was describing to you, the small bright crater on the rim of the large, fairly old crater, would be about Mike 0.8 and 8.2. Over.

This last one being based on all interpretation of the geological features that were seen by the crew on their way down. The coordinates of this second site are Mike 0.7 and 8.0.

I'm at the foot of the ladder. The LM footpads are only depressed in the surface about 1 or 2 inches, although the surface appears to be very, very fine grained, as you get close to it. It's almost like a powder. Down there, it's very fine.

There seems to be no difficulty in moving around as we suspected. It's even perhaps easier than the simulations at one sixth g that we performed in the various simulations on the ground. It's actually no trouble to walk around. Okay. The descent engine did not leave a crater of any size. It has about 1 foot clearance on the ground. We're essentially on a very level place here. I can see some evidence of rays emanating from the descent engine, but a very insignificant amount.

It has a stark beauty all its own. It's like much of the high desert of the United States. It's different but it's very pretty out here. Be advised that a lot of the rock samples out here, the hard rock samples, have what appear to be vesicles in the surface. Also, I am looking at one now that appears to have some sort of phenocryst.

I wonder if about right under the engine is where the probe might have hit.

04 13 46 20 CDR (EVA)
I'd like that.

04 13 46 25 CDR (EVA)
Yes. I think that's a good representation of our sideward velocity at touchdown there - hole at the probe.

04 13 46 30 LMP (EVA)
I see that probe over on the minus-Y strut. It's broken off and bent back up.

Forty, 50 feet. Why don't you turn around and let them get a view from there and see what the field of view looks like?

Okay, now. Do you think I ought to be farther away, or closer?

04 13 59 01 LMP (EVA)
Can't get too much further away.

Let's try it like that for a while. I'll get a couple of panoramas with it, here.

04 13 59 13 CC
Roger. You look okay as far as distance goes, Neil. And we'll line you up again when you finish the panorama. Now you're going too fast on the panorama sweep. You're going to have to stop, or -

Okay, we got that one.

04 14 00 29 CDR (EVA)
Okay. Now, this one is right down front, straight west. And I want to know if you can see an angular rock in the foreground.

04 14 00 41 CC
Roger. We have a large angular rock in the foreground, and it looks like a much smaller rock a couple of inches to the left of it. Over.

04 14 00 52 CDR (EVA)
All right. And then on beyond it about 10 feet is an even larger rock that's very rounded. That rock is about - The closest one to you is about sticking out of the sand about 1 foot. And it's about a foot and one half long, and it's about 6 inches thick, but it's standing on edge.

04 14 01 16 CC
Roger.

04 14 01 26 LMP (EVA)
Okay, Neil. I've got the table out and the bag deployed.

We've got this view, Neil.

04 14 01 42 CDR (EVA)
This is straight south.

04 14 01 45 CC
Roger. And we see the shadow of the LM.

04 14 01 48 CDR (EVA)
Roger. The little hill just beyond the shadow of the LM is a pair of elongate craters about - probably the pair together is about 40 feet long and 20 feet across, and they're probably 6 feet deep. We'll probably get some more work in there later.

Roger. We see Buzz going about his work.

Okay. You do have to be rather careful to keep track of where your center of mass is. Sometimes, it takes about two or three paces to make sure you've got your feet underneath you.

About two to three or maybe four easy paces can bring you to a nearly smooth stop. *** change directions, like a football player, you just have to to *** foot out to the side and cut a little bit.

Roger. No marks on the LM that time. I did see a suspiciously small white object whose coordinates are - -

04 14 37 25 CC
Go ahead with the coordinates on the small white object.

04 14 37 28 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Easy - Easy 0.3, 7.6, but I ... right on the southwest end of a crater. I think they would know it if they were in such a location. It looks like their LM would be pitched up quite a degree. It's on the southwest wall of a smallish crater.

04 14 37 58 CC
Roger. Copy Echo 0.3 and 7.6, and -

04 14 38 27 CC
Columbia, this is Houston. While I'm talking to you, LOS will be at 111 19 31; AOS, 112 05 43. Over.

04 14 39 04 CC
Columbia, this is Houston. Did you copy LOS AOS times? Over.

I say the jets deflector that's mounted on quad 4 seems to be - the surface of it seems lo be more wrinkled than the one that's on quad 1. Generally, underneath part of the LM seems to have stood up quite well to the *** get some pictures in the aft part of the LM that will illuminate the thermal effects much better than we could get them up here in the front.

And, Houston? Buzz here. I'm showing 3.78 psi, 63 percent, no flags, adequate, slight warming *** fingered.

*** get the panorama now. Okay.

04 14 43 33 LMP (EVA)
Did you get it?

04 14 43 50 CDR (EVA)
Houston, how does our timeline appear to be going?

04 14 43 55 CC
Roger. It looks like you're about a half hour slow on it. We're working on consumables. Over.

04 14 44 03 CDR (EVA)
All right.

04 14 44 45 CC
Neil and Buzz, this is Houston. To clarify my last, your consumables are in good shape at this time. The 30 minute reference was with respect to the nominal timeline. Over.

04 14 45 03 CDR (EVA)
Roger. I understand that.

04 14 46 36 CDR (EVA)
I don't note any abnormalities in the LM. The pods seem to be in good shape. The primary and secondary struts are in good shape. Atennas are all in place. There's no evidence of problem underneath the LM due to engine exhaust or drainage of any kind.

04 14 47 17 CC
Roger. Out.

04 14 47 18 LMP (EVA)
It's very surprising, the very surprising lack of penetration of all four of the foot pads. I'd say if we were to try and determine just how far below the surface they would have penetrated, you'd measure maybe 3 inches, wouldn't you say, Neil?

04 14 47 37 CDR (EVA)
At the most, yes. That Y strut there is probably even less than that.

04 14 47 55 LMP (EVA)
Nice paint job.

04 14 48 04 LMP (EVA)
I get a picture of the plus Y strut taken from near the descent stage, and I think we'll be able to see a little bit better what the thermal effects are. Seem to be quite minimal.

04 14 48 48 LMP (EVA)
There's one picture taken in the right rear of the spacecraft looking at the skirt of the descent stage, shows a quite darkening of the surface color, a rather minimal amount of radiating or etching away or erosion of the surface. 0n descent, both of us remarked that we could see a large amount of very fine dust particles moving out. It was reported beforehand that we would probably see an upgassing from the surface after actual engine shutdown, but as I recall, I was unable to confirm that.

04 14 50 26 LMP (EVA)
This is too big an angle, Neil.

04 14 50 34 CDR (EVA)
Yes. I think you are right.

04 14 51 29 LMP (EVA)
We're back at the minus Z strut now. *** very little force of impact that we actually had.

04 14 52 01 LMP (EVA)
And, Neil, if you'll take the camera, I'll get to work on the SEQ bay.

04 14 52 05 CDR (EVA)
Okay.

04 14 52 07 CC
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. I notice that -

04 14 52 16 CC

Can you see us underneath the LM over at the SEQ bay, Houston?

04 14 53 00 CC
Yes indeed, Buzz. We can see your feet sticking our underneath the structure of the LM descent stage.

04 14 53 08 LMP (EVA)
Okay. I'm just on the other side of the - -

04 14 53 13 CC
Now we can see you through the structure of the minus Z secondary strut.

04 14 53 38 LMP (EVA)
All right. The doors are open, and it looks like they are going to stay up without any problem.

04 14 53 46 CC
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. We are about to lose you on the OMNI's. Request high gain antenna, REACQ mode Fish 20, yaw 135. Over.

04 14 54 03 LMP (EVA)
You want to pick an area, Neil?

04 14 54 05 CC
Make that yaw 175, Columbia, yaw 175 on the high gain.

04 14 54 14 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Columbia is locked up on the high gain, Houston.

Roger.

04 14 56 30 LMP (EVA)
And the manual deployment of the LR cubed, the little spring that is at the end of the string is pulled off of the picks head. However, I was able to reach up and get hold of the picks head and pull it loose. So, it will be deployed manually, also.

04 14 57 50 LMP (EVA)
Have you got us a good area picked out?



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 71/20 Page 400

04 14 57 53 CDR (EVA)
Yes. I think right out on that rise out there is probably as good as any.

04 14 58 08 CDR (EVA)
I'll probably stay on the high ground there and - -

04 14 58 16 LMP (EVA)
Watch it; the edge of that crater is - drops - -

04 14 58 19 CDR (EVA)
Yes. It drops off there, doesn't it?

04 14 58 24 LMP (EVA)
Get a couple of close ups on these quite rounded large boulders.

04 14 58 44 CDR (EVA)
About 40 feet out - I'd say out at the end of that next - -

04 14 58 50 LMP (EVA)
It's going to be a little difficult to find a good level spot here.

04 14 58 55 CDR (EVA)
The top of that next little ridge there. Wouldn't that be a pretty good place?

04 14 59 03 LMP (EVA)
All right. Should I put the LR cubed right about here?

04 14 59 07 CDR (EVA)
All right.

04 14 59 10 LMP (EVA)
I'm going to have to get on the other side of this rock here.

04 14 59 19 CDR (EVA)
I would go right around that crater to the left there. Isn't that a level spot there?

04 14 59 25 LMP (EVA)
I think this right here is just as level.

04 15 00 00 CDR (EVA)
These boulders look like basalt, and they have probably 2 percent white minerals in them, the white crystals. And the thing that I reported as the vesicular before, I'm not - I don't believe I believe that any more. I think that small craters - they look like little impact craters where shot - B B shot has hit the surface.

04 15 02 08 LMP (EVA)
Houston. I have the seismic experiment flipped over now, and I'm aligning it, but I'm having a little bit of difficulty getting the B B in the center. It wants to move around and around on the outside. ***

You're cutting out again, Buzz.

04 15 02 49 LMP (EVA)
Roger. I say I'm not having too much success in leveling the PSE experiment.

04 15 03 57 CDR (EVA)
The laser reflector is installed and the bubble is leveled and the alignment appears to be good.

04 15 04 16 CC
Neil, this is Houston. Roger. Out.

04 15 04 23 LMP (EVA)
Hey, you want to take a look at this B B and see what you make out of it?

04 15 04 30 CDR (EVA)
I find it pretty hard to get perfectly level, too.

04 15 04 37 LMP (EVA)
That B B likes the outside. It won't go on the inside.

04 15 04 48 CDR (EVA)
That little cup is convex now, instead of concave.

04 15 04 53 LMP (EVA)
I think you're right.

04 15 04 56 CDR (EVA)
Believe it is.

04 15 04 57 LMP (EVA)
Houston, I don't think there's any hope for using this leveling device to come up with an accurate level. It looks to me as though the cup here that the B B is in is now convex instead of concave. Over.

04 15 05 19 CC
Roger, 11. Press on. If you think it looks level by eyeball, go ahead.

04 15 05 28 LMP (EVA)
Okay.

Neil, how does that appear to be pointing?

Neil, this is Houston. Over.

04 15 08 13 CDR (EVA)
Go ahead, Houston.

04 15 08 15 CC
Roger. We've been looking at your consumables, and you're in good shape. Subject to your concurrence, we'd like to extend the duration of the EVA 15 minutes from nominal. We will still give Buzz a hack at 10 minutes for heading in. Your current elapsed time is 2 plus 12. Over.

Okay. That sounds fine.

I'll do that, Buzz.

Right. We'll get a photograph of that. Houston, what time would you estimate we could allow for the documented sample? Over.

I didn't get a stereopair of those two, but they are right in the vicinity of the solar wind.

Columbia, this is Houston. We're going to uplink you a new state vector, and then we'll send the REFSMMAT up again, because sending the state vector up will wipe out the one that you have on board; and then you can do a P52 option 1. Over.

Roger, Houston. Tranquility Base. We're in the process of using up what film we have, and I'm just getting ready to change the primary ECS canister. Over.

04 16 21 14 CC
Roger, Tranquility. We'd like to hold off as long as possible on the lithium hydroxide canister. Make that one of the last things you do in getting ready for the DEPRESS, if you can. Over.

04 16 21 31 CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. We're planning on doing that. I was just wondering how much longer we want to wait, though. We've probably got another half an hour's worth of picture taking, and I guess we could run through an eat cycle and then change the canister, and then DEPRESS. Over.

04 16 21 56 CC

You might be interested in knowing, Mike, that we have gotten reflections back from the laser reflector ray they deployed, and we may be able to get some information out of that a little later.

04 16 34 45 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. I need a very precise position, because I can only do a decent job of scanning maybe one



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 72/12 Page 415

of those grid squares at a time. The area that we've been sweeping covers 10's and 20's and 30's of them.

04 16 35 00 CC
Roger. We understand. This is intended to be your last P22. We don't want to use up too much fuel in this effort. Over.

04 16 35 12 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. How's the fuel coming?

04 16 35 18 CC
Roger. There's no problem fuel wise. It's just that there seems to be a limit to the number of P22's and the number of grid squares you can search over.

04 16 35 32 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. Well, I'll continue this maneuver then to roll 82, pitch 218, yaw zero, if that's okay with you, and do a P52 in that attitude. And that'll be a sleep ...

04 16 35 48 CC
Roger. That's fine with us. And P52 in that attitude.

04 18 10 28 CDR (TRANQ)
We used the forward dump valve until about 2 psi, and we're using the overhead now.

04 18 10 34 CC
Roger. Out.

04 18 10 37 CDR (TRANQ)
They're both - they're both open now.

04 18 18 27 CDR (TRANQ)
Houston, Tranquility Base. REPRESS complete.

04 18 18 31 CC
Roger, Tranquility. We observed your equipment jettison on the TV, and the passive seismic experiment recorded shocks when each PLSS hit the surface. Over.

04 18 18 47 CDR (TRANQ)
You can't get away with anything anymore, can you?

04 18 18 51 CC
No, indeed.

Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Over.

04 18 21 34 CDR (TRANQ)
Go ahead, Houston.

04 18 21 36 CC
Roger. When you get back into your surface checklist and come over to the COMM reconfiguration on page Surface 45, we'd like you to enable the ranging feature on your S band. That is, when you come down to S band configuration, instead of CAUTION and WARNING ELECTRONICS, ENABLE TV, we'd like you to go into the RANGE position and leave it there for as long as you conveniently can until you get ready to commence your rest period; and we'll try to get a little more ranging data on you. Over.

04 18 22 20 CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Copy.

04 18 22 23 CC
And of course, when you get ready to turn in, go back into caution and warning, ENABLE, and we'd like to say from all of us down here in Houston and really from all of us in all the countries and in the entire world, we think that you've done a magnificent job up there today. Over.

04 18 22 46 CDR (TRANQ)
Thank you very much.

04 18 22 48 LMP (TRANQ)
It's been a long day.

04 18 22 51 CC
Yes, indeed. Get some rest there and have at it tomorrow.

04 18 24 06 LMP (TRANQ)
Houston, Tranquility. Did you all come up with any other solution that we might try to the mission timer problem? Over.

04 18 24 27 CC
Stand by, Tranquility. We'll be back with you in just a minute.

04 18 25 29 LMP (TRANQ)
And, Houston, Tranquility. Have you had enough TV for today?

04 18 25 34 CC
Tranquility, this is Houston. Yes, indeed. It's been a mighty fine presentation there.

04 18 25 43 LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. Signing off. See you again tomorrow.

Columbia, Colunbia, this is Houston. Over.

04 18 27 00 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Go ahead, Houston.

04 18 27 02 CC
Roger. Sorry to bother you, Columbia. Two things: we request that you select 10 degree deadband in your DAP in accordance with the procedures on Foxtrot 9 7 in your checklist; and secondly, we'd like to leave a display on the DSKY that is not one that's cycling, being continuously updated. What you have when you get through widening the deadband will be a static display, and that'll be satisfactory. Over.

04 18 27 41 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay.

04 18 27 42 CC
Roger. Goodnight again.

Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Over.

04 18 28 16 LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Go ahead.

04 18 28 19 CC
Roger. On your mission timer, we wanted to pull the circuit breaker and let it cool down for an hour and a half to 2 hours. I believe the breaker is currently open. It has been off, so go ahead and reset the mission timer circuit breaker. Put the timer control to RESET and hold it in RESET for 30 seconds, and then slew it to your desired settings left to right, and place the timer control to START. Over.

04 18 29 04 LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. We'll try it.

04 18 29 55 CDR (TRANQ)
Houston, our mission timer seems to be slewing okay. You want to give us a time hack? Or can we get it off the CMC LGC, I mean?

04 18 30 23 CC
Roger, Tranquility. I'll give you a time hack at 114 31 00. It's about 30 seconds from now. Over.

04 18 30 51 CC
Stand by for a Mark at 114 31.

04 18 31 00 CC
MARK.

04 18 31 14 CC
Tranquility, this is Houston. Did you copy my Mark at 114 31?

04 18 31 22 CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Thank you, and our mission timer is running now.

04 18 31 27 CC
Roger. Very good. And, I've got a consumables update for you if you're ready to copy or listen. Over.

04 18 31 38 LMP (TRANQ)
Stand by.

04 18 31 43 LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. Go ahead.

04 18 31 45 CC
Okay. RCS Alfa is 81 percent, RCS Bravo 75 percent. Coming up on 115 hours GET, descent oxygen is 31.8 pounds or 59 percent; descent amp hours 858, and ascent amp hours 574. Over.

Roger. Copy. Thank you very much.

04 18 32 32 CC
Roger. Out.

04 18 33 06 CC
Tranquility, this is Houston. We also have a set of about 10 questions relating to observations you made, things you may have seen during the EVA. You can either discuss a little later on this evening or sometime later in the mission at your option. How do you feel? Over.

04 18 33 35 CDR (TRANQ)
I guess we can take them up now.

04 18 33 39 CC
Okay. And your friendly Green Team here has pretty well been relieved by your friendly Maroon Team, and I'll put Owen on with the questions.

04 18 33 52 CC
Tranquility - -

04 18 33 53 CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. Thank you, Bruce. Go ahead.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 74/4 Page 426

04 18 33 59 CC
Tranquility, Houston. First question here is how your best estimate of the yaw on the - of the LM as compared to the nominal preflight plan. Over.

04 18 34 16 LMP (TRANQ)
We got 13 degrees left on the ball, and I think that's probably about right. Looking at the shadow and so on, we prob - probably about 13 degrees left of the shadow.

04 18 34 31 CC
Roger. That's 13 degrees left of the shadow. And, next question relates to the depth of the bulk sampling that you obtained near the first part of the EVA and any changes in composition that you might have observed during the bulk sampling interval. Over.

04 18 35 02 CDR (TRANQ)
I'm not sure I understand that question, but we got a good bit of the ground mass in the bulk sample plus a sizable number of selected rock fragments of different types.

04 18 35 22 CC
Roger, Neil. One of the implications here is the depth from which the bulk sample was collected. Did you manage to get down there several inches or nearer the surface? Over.

04 18 35 37 CDR (TRANQ)
We got some down from as much as 3 inches in the area where I was looking at variation with depth in the bulk sample. There really wasn't appreciable difference, and I didn't run into any hard bed. Later on, or at some other times and other areas, why, I'd get down just a short distance, an inch or two, and couldn't go any further.

04 18 36 06 CC
Roger. Believe we understand down as deep as 3 inches, did not hit any hard bed, and no significant changes in composition to that depth. Next question, the - the second SRC was packed rather hurriedly due to the time limitation, and wonder if you would be able to provide any more detailed description of the samples which were included in the second SRC. Over.

04 18 36 40 CDR (TRANQ)
We got two core tubes and solar wind and about half of the big sample bag full of assorted rocks which I picked up hurriedly from around the area. I tried to get as many representative types as I could.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 74/5 Page 427

04 18 37 09 CC
Roger, Neil. Next topic here relates to the rays which emanate from the DPS engine burning area. We're wondering if the rays emanating from the - beneath the engine are any darker or lighter than the surrounding surface. Over.

04 18 37 42 LMP (TRANQ)
The ones that I saw back in the aft end of the spacecraft appeared to be a good bit darker; of course, viewed from the aft end, why, they did have the Sun shining directly on them. It seemed as though the material had been baked somewhat and also scattered in a radially outward direction, but in that particular area, this feature didn't extend more than about 2, maybe 3 feet, from the skirt of the engine. Over.

04 18 38 24 CC
Roger. Understand that near the aft end out to the east that the rays did appear darker. I understand, Buzz, that these were - this was the appearance of the material which had been uncovered by the rays that appeared darker for 2 or 3 feet extending outward. Is that correct?

04 18 38 49 LMP (TRANQ)
No. I wouldn't say it was necessarily material that had been uncovered. I think some of the material might have been baked or in some way caused to be more cohesive and perhaps flow together in some way, I don't know. Now, in other areas, before we started trampling around out front, why, we could see that small erosion had taken place in a radially outward direction, but it had left no significant mark on the surface other than just having eroded it away. Now, it was different back in the - right under the skirt itself. It seems as though the surface had been baked in a streak fashion, and I think a couple of pictures on film will show this. But that didn't extend out very far. Over.

04 18 39 48 CC
Roger, Tranquility. And this baked appearance that you described, at least the suggestion is that it was due to the heat of the engine at any rate. Next subject, did - -

04 18 40 01 LMP (TRANQ)
I believe so.

04 18 40 02 CC
Roger. Next subject, did either of the solar panels on the PSE touch the surface of the Moon during deployment? Over.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 74/6 Page 428

04 18 40 19 LMP (TRANQ)
I think that two corners did touch, since when it was deployed, both of them didn't come out at the same time. It unfolded a little unevenly, and of course, the terrain that it was on was a little bit - not quite as level as it was - as I would like to have it. And I think that two corners did touch to about 1 inch - no, three quarters to a half an inch deep; and maybe along the bottom, it might have been maybe 3 inches, leaving a small triangular coating on two of the corners; and I think these are on the western ones. Over.

04 18 41 06 CC
Roger. Understand the description there. And the next subject, on the two core tubes which you collected, how did the driving force required to collect these tubes compare? Was there any difference? Over

04 18 41 27 LMP (TRANQ)
Not significantly. I could get down to about the first 2 inches without much of a problem, and then as I would pound it in about as hard as I could do it, and the second one took two hands on the hammer, and I was putting pretty good dents in the top of the extension rod, and it just wouldn't go much more than - I think the total depth might have been about 8 or 9 inches. But even there, it didn't - For some reason it didn't seem to want to stand up straight. In other words, I'd keep driving it in and it would dig some sort of a hole but it wouldn't - just penetrate in a way that would support it and keep it from falling over, if that makes any sense at all. It didn't really to me. Over.

04 18 42 22 CC
Roger, Buzz. I think I've got the picture. You indicate that little difference between the two samples and that in each case you got down about 2 inches without any problems and then had to continue hammering rather vigorously in order to continue driving it in to a total depth of 8 or 9 inches, and even at that point the rods did not want to stay vertical, that they'd tend to fall over on you even after pounding in that far. Is that correct?

04 18 42 59 LMP (TRANQ)
Yes. That's about it. It wasn't a rapid change in resistive force. And also I noticed when I took the bit off that the material was quite well packed, a good bit darker, and it - The way it adhered to the core tube gave me the distinct impression of being moist. Over.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 74/7 Page 429

04 18 43 23 CC
Roger. Understand the general impression of being moist as it packed in the core tube. Next question: we did copy your comments prior to the EVA of your general description of the area. We wonder if either of you would have any more lengthy description or more detailed description of the general summary of the geology of the area. Over.

04 18 44 01 LMP (TRANQ)
Yes let's - we'll - We'll postpone our answer to that one until tomorrow. Okay?

04 18 44 08 CC
Yes, indeed. That'll be fine. Just a couple more here, and I think these may not be quite as lengthy as number 7 there. Can you estimate the stroke of the primary and secondary struts? Over.

04 18 44 31 CDR (TRANQ)
Well, I could do it like this, Owen. About all the struts are about equally stroked, and the height from the ground to the first step is about 3 feet or maybe 3 and 1/2 feet, huh?

04 18 44 52 CC
Roger. Understand, Neil. Next topic, as - just after landing, you pointed out that there was a hill to the west along the plus Z axis from the LM. Are there any large rocks in that direction that might block the solar ray during the sunset - as sunset approaches in your locality - Are there any large rocks that might tend to obscure the ray? Over.

04 18 45 32 LMP (TRANQ)
No. I don't believe so, I think that it's - It's about as level as any other areas that we chose.

04 18 45 46 CC
Roger. I - -

04 18 45 47 LMP (TRANQ)
There's nothing large, anyway, that's going to get in the way.

04 18 45 50 CC
Roger. Copy. That's also the way it appeared from the television, I think. And now the final question. You commented, Neil, that on your approach to the landing spot, you had passed over a football field sized crater containing rather large blocks of solid rock perhaps 10 to 15 feet in size. Can you estimate the distance to this football sized crater from your present position? Over.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape74/8 Page 430

04 18 46 25 CDR (TRANQ)
I thought we'd be close enough so that when we got outside we could see its rim back there but I couldn't. But I don't think that we're more than a half mile beyond it. That is a half mile west of it.

04 18 46 45 CC
Roger. So you estimate your present position less than half a mile approximately west of this large crater. Over.

04 18 46 56 CDR (TRANQ)
That's correct.

04 18 46 58 CC
Okay. Well, that takes care of the questions from our geologists for tonight, and unless you have something else, that'll be all for - from us for the evening. Over.

04 18 47 12 LMP (TRANQ)
Okay. Thank you.

04 18 49 01 CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. We've now collected all the ranging data that we can use, and you can go back to caution and warning ENABLE. Over.

04 18 49 14 LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Will do.

04 18 52 18 CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. Over.

04 18 52 27 LMP (TRANQ)
Go ahead, Houston.

04 18 52 28 CC
Roger. Two more verifications, here. Can you - will you verify that the disk with messages was placed on the surface as planned, and also that the items listed in the flight plan - all of those listed there were jettisoned. Over.

04 18 52 48 LMP (TRANQ)
That's - All that's verified.

04 18 52 51 CC
Roger. Thank you, and I hope this will be a final good night.

04 18 52 57 LMP (TRANQ)
Okay.

Columbia, Columbia, good morning from Houston.

05 00 59 12 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Hi, Ron.

05 00 59 14 CC
Hey, Mike, how's it going this morning?

05 00 59 17 CMP (COLUMBIA)
How goes it?

05 00 59 18 CC
Hey, real fine. While you're - -

05 00 59 20 CMP (COLUMBIA)
I don't know yet, how's it going with you?

05 00 59 23 CC
Real fine here. Columbia, request P00 and ACCEPT. We'll shove the state vector in for you right away.

05 00 59 57 CC
Okay. It's coming up now, Columbia. We're going to keep you a little busy here. As soon as we get the state vector in, we'd like you to go ahead and do a P52 option 3 on this night pass, and then when you come on around the other side there, we'll give you some landmark tracking information on prime 130.

05 01 00 29 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay.

05 01 00 34 CC
And for your information, we're also going to have Tranquility Base do a P52 when you come around the other time; and I have the P22 information if you're ready to copy.

05 01 00 54 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Go ahead.

05 01 00 56 CC
Okay. Track landmark 130 prime using P22, and for information, this will properly position your rendezvous radar transponder. T1 is 122 plus 16 plus 05 - whoops, okay. Stand by.

05 01 02 04 CC
Columbia, Houston. The computer is yours.

05 01 02 12 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. And I'd like the grid square of this crater 130 prime. Over.

05 01 02 24 CC
Columbia, Houston. Say again about 130 prime.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 78/2 Page 435

05 01 02 31 CMP (COLUMBIA)
I'd like its grid square, please.

05 01 02 35 CC
Roger. Stand by.

05 01 04 58 CC
Columbia, Houston.

05 01 05 08 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Go ahead.

05 01 05 09 CC
Roger. I have the T1 and T2 times and also the longitude of the 130 prime. We're working on the grid squares and we'll get them shortly.

05 01 05 26 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. Ready to copy.

05 01 05 28 CC
Okay. T1: 122 plus 16 plus 05. Tango 2 is 122 plus 21 plus 11, and 6 miles north of track. And do you want your NOUN 89 values?

05 01 05 58 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Yes, please.

05 01 06 00 CC
Roger. Latitudes, plus 01.243. Longitude over 2, plus 11.844. Altitude, minus 001.46. Over.

05 01 06 32 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Copy T1: 122 16 05. T2: 122 21 11, 6 miles north, NOUN 89 is plus 01243, plus 11844, minus 00146.

05 01 06 51 CC
Columbia, affirmative. And at the T1 time, put your rendezvous radar transponder switch to OPERATE.

05 01 07 05 CMP (COLUMBIA)
All right.

05 01 07 06 CC
And this 130 prime is the same one that you tracked prior to descent. Over.

05 01 07 23 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Okay. You've updated your information as to the LM's position and this is your best estimate of where the LM is, is that correct?

05 01 07 37 CC
Columbia, that's negative. This 130 is the little bitty crater there that you tracked - John Young's crater - that you tracked prior to descent. And we want that - -

05 01 07 50 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Fine. Okay. You've given up looking for that.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 78/3 Page 436

05 01 07 53 CC
Affirmative. We want this for one last fix on your plane.

05 01 08 00 CMP (COLUMBIA)
All right. Fine. Understand. Thank you.

05 01 08 05 CC
And when the LM does his P22 on your transponder, well then, that'll be our last shot at the LM's position.

05 01 08 14 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. Understand. Do you care whether my transponder is on before T1?

05 01 08 35 CC
Roger. It'll be on WARMUP prior to that time, and you can go to OPERATE anywhere around that time.

05 01 08 44 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Yes. I gather it's on its 24 minute warmup now?

05 01 08 47 CC
Roger.

05 01 08 53 CC
And, Houston. The computer is yours, you can go to BLOCK anytime.

05 01 08 59 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. BLOCK, going P52, option 3.

05 01 09 02 CC
Roger. And we'll see you coming around the other side. About 1 minute to go, and all your systems are looking good.

05 01 09 11 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Thanks, Ron.

Good morning, Houston. Tranquility Base. Over.

05 01 40 49 CC
Roger. Loud and clear. And how is the resting standing up there. Did you get a chance to curl up on the engine can?

05 01 41 02 LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Neil has rigged himself a really good hammock with a waste tether, and he's been lying



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 78/4 Page 437

on the ascent engine cover, and I curled up on the floor. Over.

05 01 41 14 CC
Roger. Copy, Buzz. Got a couple of changes to your surface checklist here, and in general, what we're going to want you to do is P22, tracking the command module for one last hack on your position there. And this will be - in other words, P57, P22, and then to press on with the checklist, and the rest of them are a couple of minor changes in the checklist. The main one being that we do not want the rendezvous radar on during the ascent, and we think that this will take care of some of the overflow of program alarms which we're getting during descent.

05 01 42 05 CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. We had the rendezvous radar in SLEW during descent, though.

05 01 42 14 CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. I missed that. Say again.

05 01 42 21 CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. I say again. We had the rendezvous radar switch in the SLEW position, not the LGC position.

05 01 42 33 CC
Roger. We copy that. But there's a greater duty cycle on - There's a good 15 percent duty cycle on the ascent program there, so just go ahead and leave it off. And I have the changes there if you want to get out your surface checklist, and I can go ahead and start giving them to you.

05 01 42 59 CDR (TRANQ)
All right. Go ahead. I've got it out.

05 01 43 01 CC
Okay. Before we start here, request P00 and DATA, and we'll give you some vectors.

05 01 43 23 CDR (TRANQ)
Now you've got P00 and DATA.

05 01 43 25 CC
Okay. And on Surface 50 will be the first change there.

05 01 43 35 CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. And I understand you want us to do a P57 option 3 and then a P22, is that the general idea? Over.

05 01 43 44 CC
That's affirmative. So on Surface 50 there, down at the bottom of the page, just after PRO after two recycles, stick in a time of 122 plus 15; do P22 as per PGNS 20 of G&N dictionary. Over.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 78/5 Page 438

05 01 44 21 CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Understand that's 122 15, do P22 as per PGNS 20, G&N dictionary.

05 01 44 29 CC
Roger. Okay. Let's skip on over to Surface 59.

05 01 44 50 CDR (TRANQ)
Okay.

05 01 44 51 CC
Okay. This is going to be for one last vent on the DPS tank there, so at the top of the page just after EPS INVERTER 1, CLOSE, add - Okay, after EPS INVERTER 1, CLOSE, add PROP DESCENT HELIUM REG/VENT CLOSE, and then after STABILIZATION/CONTROL AELD, CLOSE, add PROP DISPLAYS/ENGINE 0VERRIDE/LOGIC, CLOSE. Over.

05 01 46 02 CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. Copy. These are two circuit breakers, right?

05 01 46 20 CC
Tranquility Base, affirmative. Those are just the circuit breakers at that time.

05 01 46 53 CC
Tranquility Base, Houston. Did you get those two on the propulsion circuit breakers?

05 01 47 02 CDR (TRANQ)
Roger. I have those two.

05 01 51 08 CDR (TRANQ)
Okay. Then it looks to me like we ought to get hopping on this P57.

05 01 51 21 CC
Roger. We agree wholeheartedly. And while you're starting on that, I'll read - just read these notes on P22. Call P22 possible program alarm 5.6, range greater than 400 nautical miles, and then use the P22 as described on PGNS 20. Take option 1 in NOUN 06, and use the no update mode. The rendezvous radar will lock on at about 25 degrees elevation above the horizon. If 503 alarm occurs, designate fail. Key a PROCEED and allow the rendezvous radar to search for the CSM. And place the range altitude monitor switch in altitude/altitude rate to prevent the tape meter from driving into the stops. And press on.

05 03 10 32 CDR (TRANQ)
And, Houston, Tranquility Base is going to give you a few comments with regard to the geology question of last night. We are landed in a relatively smooth crater field of elongate secondary - circular secondary craters, most of which have rims irrespective of their - raised rims irrespective of their size. That's'not universally true. There are - There are a few of the smaller craters around which do not have a discernable rim. The ground mass throughout the area is a very fine sand to a silt. I'd say the thing that would be most like it on Earth is powdered graphite. Immersed in this ground mass are a wide variety of rock shapes, sizes, textures, rounded and angular, many with varying consistencies. As I said, I've seen plain - what looked to be plain basalt and vesicular basalt. Others with no crystals, some with small white phenocrysts, maybe one to less than 5 percent. And the bould - we are in a boulder field where the boulders range generally up to 2 feet with a few larger than that. Now, some of the boulders are lying on top of the surface, some are partially exposed, and some are just barely exposed. And in our traverse around on the surface and particularly working with the scoop, we've run into boulders below the surface - it was probably buried under several inches of the ground mass.

05 03 12 55 CC
Tranquility, Houston. Roger. Very fine description.

05 03 13 05 CDR (TRANQ)
I suspect this boulder field may have some of its origin with this large sharp edged rocky rim crater that we passed over at final descent. Now yesterday I said that was about the size of a football field, and I have to admit it was a little - little hard to measure coming in. But I thought that it might just fit in the Astrodome as we came by it. And the rocks in the vicinity of the - of this rocky rim crater are much larger than these in this area. Some are 10 feet or so and perhaps bigger, and they are very thickly populated out to about one crater diameter beyond the crater rim. Beyond that, there is some diminishing, and even out in this area the blocks seem to run out in rows with irregular patterns, and then there are paths between them where there are considerably less surface evidence of hard rocks. Over.

05 03 18 41 CDR (TRANQ)
Go ahead, Houston.

05 03 18 43 CC
Roger. For your P57 ..., we did a little looking around, and it looks like Sirius and Rigel out at detent 6 would be real good on that. The Sun angle on Sirius is about 43 degrees, and on Rigel, it's about 55 degrees. Over.

05 03 19 08 LMP (TRANQ)
Roger, Houston. The only trouble is that the Sun is in number 5, the closed one. And it appears to also be close enough to detent 6 to shine on the far side of the cone. And it completely obscures detent 6. I'm - unable to use that at all.

05 03 19 37 CC
Okay. We understand it now, and thank you.

05 03 20 43 CC
Tranquility, Houston. For your information, the circuitry looks real fine on that ascent engine arm circuit breaker.

05 03 23 10 LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Why do you think I need to move the radar?

05 03 23 14 CC
Well, we thought that you probably wouldn't be able to get the star there.

05 03 23 36 LMP (TRANQ)
On the rear detent, the radar can be pointing plus X, and I'm - I'll be using right rear. That's okay.

05 03 23 44 CC
Roger. That's fine then.

Roger. Understand. Shaft 335.

05 03 26 29 CC
Roger. And if the steerable doesn't quite hack it on lift off, looks like the forward OMNI is good for about 30 to 60 seconds after lift off. And then the aft OMNI antenna is good for the rest of the ascent. Over.

05 03 26 52 LMP (TRANQ)
Roger. Copy.

05 03 27 10 LMP (TRANQ)
Houston, we've got two angles here at 3 minutes in ascent. Would you confirm those? Pitch 134 and yaw minus 32. Over.

Okay. Wide deadband on.

05 05 02 04 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Houston, Columbia. Also my VHF ranging is not working now, and I'd like to know whether you'd like me to continue making sextant marks or do nothing. I'm supposed to be doing VHF marks only, and it's for the next 6 or 7 minutes.

05 05 02 20 CC
Columbia, Houston. Roger. We copy. And, Eagle, looks like the best antenna would be forward for the LM. And, break. Eagle, we missed your loading of the TPI TIG and P32. Could you confirm you've done that?

05 05 03 00 CC
Columbia, Houston. Recommend you take sextant marks and do not reinitialize. Over.

05 05 05 12 CMP (COLUMBIA)
Roger. I've just got time for maybe two sextant marks, then get on with the final count.

05 05 05 57 CC
Eagle and Columbia, about 1 minute till LOS there on Columbia. It looks like we have about 51.5 for CSI, and we tend to confirm your Y dot. And, break. For Eagle, verify VHF Bravo transmitter is off.

Okay. The CSI burn was on scheduled time of 125 19 3470, 51.5 feet per second was our solution. After chasing residuals a little bit, we ended up with a minus 0.2, plus 0.7, and minus 0.1. And in the AGS, at that time, we had plus 0.4, plus 0.9, and plus 0.3.

05 06 01 24 LMP (EAGLE)
That's affirmative. We started getting an erratic indication on primary, so we switched to secondary, and it was again erratic and I thought it might have been a sensor. But it's settled down now, and we're on the secondary. Over.

That's right.

I'm not going to do a thing, Mike. I'm just letting her hold in ATTITUDE HOLD.

Okay.

05 08 03 43 CMP
I'm pumping up cabin pressure.

05 08 04 29 CMP
That was a funny one. You know, I didn't feel it shock, and I thought things were pretty steady. I went to RETRACT there, and that's when all hell broke loose. Were you guys - did it appear to you to be - that you were jerking around quite a bit during the retrack cycle?

05 08 04 50 CDR
Yes. It seemed to happen at the time I put the plus X thrust to it, and apparently it wasn't centered, because somehow or other I accidentally got off in attitude and then the attitude hold system started firing.

05 08 05 09 CMP
Yes. I was sure busy there for a couple of seconds.

05 08 05 19 CMP
Are you hearing me all right? I got a horrible squeal.

05 08 05 22 CDR
Yes. I agree with that, but we hear you okay. Over.

Houston, Apollo 11. Over.

05 08 05 39 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Go.

05 08 05 44 CMP
Roger. I'm supposed to adjust the oxygen flow in this thing to six tenths of a pound per hour, but being as how this transducer is not working right, could you give me an updated number?

05 08 05 55 CC
Affirmative. You want to go ahead and adjust your O2 flow until it just goes off the peg, and then crank the direct O2 valve back down about 5 degrees. Over.

05 08 06 14 CMP
Boy, you were really waiting for that one, weren't you? Okay, Ron. Thank you.

05 08 06 59 CMP
Houston, I did that, and I believe we are flowing oxygen, but the gage is just pegged FULL SCALE LOW.

05 08 07 08 CC
Roger. That's fine. That's what we expect.

05 08 07 13 CMP
Okay.

05 08 07 24 CMP
Okay. I'm going to go ahead with the tunnel leak check.

05 08 07 32 CC
Columbia, Houston. I have a new LM weight for you whenever you're ready to copy.

05 08 07 45 CMP
Not right now, Ron. Remind me of it later, would you please?

05 08 07 50 CC
Roger. We'll stand by.

05 08 08 56 CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. I let P47 run longer than I should. I may have deteriorated our state vector slightly.

05 08 09 06 CC
Roger, Apollo 11. That's okay. We'll see later.

05 08 11 03 CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead with your DAP up, please.

05 08 11 07 CC
Roger. Your LM weight, 5785. For an R1 we'd like to have 61102, R2 01111. Use BD roll. Over.

05 08 11 35 CMP
Roger. I'm configured now at ... for BD roll, and I have thrusters C4 and B3 turned off, and I copy register 1 61102 01111 and LM weight 5785. Thank you.

05 08 11 52 CC
Roger, Columbia.

05 08 13 57 CMP
Houston, Columbia has completed the leak check, and proceeding with opening the hatch dump valve.

05 08 14 07 CC
Roger, Columbia. Understand you're doing the leak check. I missed anything after that.

05 08 14 13 CMP
I say the leak check is complete, and I'm proceeding with opening the hatch dump valve.

05 08 14 23 CC
Eagle - Columbia, Roger.

05 08 20 03 CMP
Eagle, Columbia.

05 08 20 07 LMP
Go ahead.

05 08 20 08 CMP
My hatch is removed. You can open yours, and I'll start passing stuff up to you.

05 08 20 12 LMP
Okay.

Yes, everything is going fine. Be with you in just a second.

05 08 30 10 CC
Eagle, Houston. Over.

05 08 30 16 LMP
Go ahead, Houston, Eagle here.

05 08 30 17 CC
Roger. Any time prior to jettison there, we'd like an AGS to PGNS align: 400 plus 30 000. Over.

05 08 30 34 LMP
Okay. Any particular attitude you would like the PGNS in when we do that?

05 08 30 47 LMP
No. We're not getting any. Could you give us some course align gimbal angles to move the PGNS to, and then we will align the AGS to the PGNS. Over.

05 08 30 58 CC
Roger. Eagle. We concur. Stand by on the gimbal angles. And also, Eagle, while we've got the command module direct O2 on there, there's a possibility that your cabin relief might relieve if we get up around cabin pressure of about 5.4 or 5.5.

05 08 31 24 LMP
Roger.

05 08 32 05 CC
Eagle, Houston.

05 08 32 10 LMP
Roger. Go ahead.

05 08 32 11 CC
Roger. All we are trying to do is get PGNS and AGS aligned together. Doesn't make any difference on the gimbal angle.

05 08 32 28 CDR
...

05 08 32 34 LMP
Okay. We are pretty close to 000. Is that all right?

05 08 32 38 CC
Eagle, that's beautiful.

05 08 32 44 LMP
Now, you might want to take into account what will happen when the CSM maneuvers to jettison attitude.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 83/2 Page 485

05 08 32 56 CC
Eagle, Houston. We don't care what - All we are trying to do is get a drift rate and see how long it takes them to drift apart on the thing after you jettison.

05 08 33 08 LMP
Okay. Will we be jettisoning at about this attitude? That's okay. I'll align the AGS with the PGNS. You can tell me a little later if you need some help.

05 08 33 22 CC
Eagle, Houston. That's fine.

05 08 36 31 CMP
Houston, Columbia. You want me to roll over and get high gain or anything like that?

05 08 36 38 CC
Columbia, Houston. I can give you some REACQ angles for the high gain on the LM jettison attitude. Then you can go there whenever you want to. The angles are pitch minus 50, and yaw zero.

05 08 37 02 CMP
Okay.

05 08 38 07 CMP
Houston, Columbia. Say again the jettison roll, pitch, and yaw, please.

Hey, Columbia. Houston. Mighty fine; loud and clear.

Okay. Coming up. Houston, do you have any preferences as to what you want us to do with the probe? Over.

05 08 45 36 CC
Columbia, Houston. Stand by one.

05 08 45 43 CMP
Okay. Eagle says they've got a place for it inside there, so no problem.

Roger. Neil, just a reminder again, the ACA out of detent to zero; the AGS out of there just in case you go to ATTITUDE HOLD shortly.

05 08 49 47 CDR
Okay.

You say you wanted the probe now?

05 08 53 46 CC
Eagle, Houston.

05 08 53 53 CDR
Houston, Eagle. Go ahead.

05 08 53 54 CC
Roger. That ACA out of detent didn't quite do it because the mode control switches were off. Request guidance control to PGNS and then back to AGS, and that will zero the AGS, there. Over.

05 08 54 12 CDR
Say again, please.

05 08 54 14 CC
Roger. Request guidance control switch to PGNS and then back to AGS. Over.

05 08 54 23 CDR
Okay. We still have both mode control switches off. Over.

05 08 54 28 CC
That's okay. That's good.

05 08 54 39 CDR
And I thought I'd just take about 5 seconds here and see if I could get 000 gone, since we're fairly close to gimbal lock right now.

05 08 54 56 CC
Eagle, Houston. That's fine.

05 08 58 03 CC
Columbia and Eagle, Houston. About 5 minutes to LOS. Your LM jet time will be 131 plus 52, and I have the rest of the maneuver PAD if you want it now, or I can give it to you on the next time around.

Roger, Eagle. Correction - Roger, Columbia. We copy. You guys are speedy; you beat us to the punch. We had a couple of things for you.

05 09 51 25 CDR
What are they?

05 09 51 26 CC
Oh, it was just - We wanted you to close the CO2 sensor breaker and give us an RCS onboard readout out of Eagle, but that's all. Columbia, Houston. We've got a state vector for you if you'll give us P00 in ACCEPT. Over.

05 09 51 54 CDR
Buzz says the CO2 sensor circuit breaker is IN

05 09 51 58 CC
Roger. Thank you very much.

05 09 52 09 CDR
The RCS quantity was approximately 60 at A and 45 percent at B.

05 09 52 14 CC
Roger.

05 09 52 19 CDR
And we're going P00 in ACCEPT.

05 09 52 21 CC

Columbia, Houston. Your friendly White Team's going to be on till we get you on the way home, and we'd like to congratulate everybody on a successful rendezvous and a beautiful EVA. It was a great show for everybody. Over.

Thank you, sir. I'll tell Neil and Buzz.

Houston, the hatch passes its integrity check. I'm going to go to LM tunnel VENT now, and leave it there.

05 09 54 51 CC
Roger, Colualbia. We copy. That's good, and we'd like a readout on the TEP of about the time you - that Eagle selected the secondary loop. Over.

05 09 55 05 CDR
Stand by.

Hello, Columbia. Houston. We got the load in. You can do the VERB 66 and the computer is yours. Over.

05 09 55 24 CDR
Roger.

05 09 56 01 LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. I'd say that the secondary loop was actuated about 15 to 20 minutes ago. Over.

Columbia, Houston. It looks like you guys are so speedy on us that we're thinking about moving up jettison time to about a GET of 130 plus 30, if that's okay with you all. Over.

05 09 57 41 CMP
That's fine. I've still got to get a P30 PAD from you.

05 09 57 49 CC
Roger. We want to talk to you about that. Mike, we can - for your druthers, we can do it either way. We can either let you do it in the jettison in P30 - correction P47, or we can send you a P30 target load up and then you - let you call P41, whichever you want to do. Over.

05 09 58 13 CMP
Yes, I see. Ron was going to give me a P30 PAD and the flight plan says P47. Out of the two, I prefer to go to P30, P41 route.

05 09 58 20 CC
Roger. Beautiful. We've got the load. If you'll give us P00 and ACCEPT, we'll send you a load up. Stand by.

05 09 58 41 CC
Columbia, Houston. We'd like you to terminate direct O2 flow, and stand by on your P00 and ACCEPT. We'll have to generate a new load due to the moveup on time. Over.

05 09 58 56 CMP
Roger.

05 10 02 13 CC
Columbia, Houston. Over.

05 10 02 19 CMP
Go ahead.

05 10 02 21 CC
Roger, Mike. It looks like if we move up this jettison time and give you a new load, it would require a new attitude, and we can't do that due to the LM already closed out, and it would fight us all the way around and we'd lose COMM with it. We're thinking separating in P47 in about 10 minutes. We're looking at trajectories and we'll be right with you momentarily. Over.

05 10 02 46 CMP
Okay. It's no big thing with me either way.

Charlie, did it hold cabin pressure this time?

05 10 10 35 CC
Say again, Buzz. Over.

05 10 10 36 LMP
Okay. I thrusted back - I thrusted back toward it a little bit, Charlie, and I'm now reading NOUN 83, plus four balls 4, minus four balls 8, and you want me to kill average D. Right?

Stand by. That's affirmative. You can exit P47.

05 10 11 05 CDR
There she goes. It was a good one.

05 10 11 08 CC
Roger dodger. We got Eagle looking good. It's holding cabin pressure and it picked up about 2 feet per second from that jettison.

05 10 11 19 LMP
I believe that. I can see some cracks on the outer coating around the tunnel. In the thermal protective covering, I don't think it has anything to do with the structure.

05 10 11 35 CC
Roger.

05 10 12 43 CC
Hello, Columbia, Houston. We'll have an attitude and a little blip burn for you in about 130 30, so we can separate from Eagle. Over.

05 10 12 56 CMP
That's fine.

05 10 16 49 CC
Columbia, Houston. Would you start a maneuver to a pitch of 230 for this little tweak burn? Over.

05 10 17 01 CMP
Roger. Pitch 230.

05 10 17 03 CC
Roger, Mike. And verify track mode in AUTO for the high gain.

We're in REACQ. Is that all right?

05 10 17 17 CC
Say again. We need AUTO.

Roll zero, pitch 320, yaw zero?

Apollo 11, these days.

05 10 19 12 CC
Oh, Roger, Apollo 11. We got you going to a posigrade attitude and we want you - this burn will be using minus X thrusters at about 2 or 3 feet per second, and we got a load for you. We'll send it up momentarily. Over.

05 10 19 33 CMP
Okay.

05 10 20 56 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Would you give us P00 and ACCEPT? We have a load for you. Over.

05 10 21 02 CMP
You got it.

Go ahead. Ready to copy.

05 10 22 32 CC
That's affirmative, Apollo 11. And, Mike, it's similar to the SEP burn prior to flight after the undocking here. And the P41 you should see on register 1 - 2, and then you burn minus X until you read 4. Over.

05 10 24 11 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. Computer's yours. Over.

05 10 24 19 CMP
Roger, Charlie. We switched our OMNI D - Delta, and I lost that last transmission. Would you say again, please? The thing I'm wondering about specifically is that earlier you said it would be minus X thrusters and the PAD indicates plus X. Do you want me to null that to zero or do you want to add 2 and leave it as a 4?

05 10 24 39 CC
Roger, Apollo 11. The way we gave it to you in the attitude we're in, it'll be just like the SEP burn that you had yesterday. You'll see - NOUN 85 will give you a plus 2 and then you just burn minus X until you read 4. Over.

05 10 24 58 CMP
Understand.

05 10 25 50 CC
Apollo 11, Houston. We see you in P41 now. It might take you a couple of minutes to integrate these vectors that we gave you and if you don't make TIG, it's pretty insensitive. You can just let P41 bring you up to TIG, and when you get to zero, you can burn on that. Over.

05 10 26 12 CMP
Okay.

Okay. Burn complete. Residuals: plus three balls 40, plus four balls 7, plus four balls 2, DELTA-V counter 102.1. Over.

Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. A couple of things for you. Over.

05 10 34 46 CMP
Go ahead.

05 10 34 47 CC
Okay. Mike, you can maneuver to your preliminary TEI attitude as shown on page 398 of the flight plan, and the high gain angles are good as shown in the flight plan, and we'd like you to dump the waste water at 131 05 down to 10 percent. Over.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 84/6 Page 495

05 10 35 13 CMP
Okay. Understand. I'm going to go to roll 1.1, pitch zero - or 52.6, and yaw 13.8, and you want a waste water dump 10 percent starting at 131 05.

05 10 35 28 CC
That's affirmative. Right out the LOS.

You're loud and clear, Charlie. What - What numbers are you looking at for TEI TIG preliminary; 135 hours 23 minutes, something like that?

05 10 47 05 CC
That's affirmative, Mike. We're looking at about nominal time. We've considered kicking it up a REV, but we don't think this REV track is going to be any good since we had the RCS burn and we need some more tracking to get you a good TEI. Over.

That's what we're looking for.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. If you guys want it, we've got some news, here, we can read up. Over.

05 12 16 09 CDR
Be pleased to have it.

05 12 16 11 CC
Roger, Neil. Starting off: Congratulatory messages on the Apollo 11 mission have been pouring into the White House from world leaders in a steady stream all day. Among the latest are telegrams from Prime Minister Harold Wilson of Great Britain and the King of Belgium. The world's press has been dominated by news of Apollo 11. Some newsmen estimate that more than 60 percent of the news used in papers across the country today concerned your mission. The New York Times which, as we mentioned before, has had such a demand for its edition of the paper today (even though it ran 950 000 copies) said it will reprint the whole thing on Thursday as a souvenir edition. And Premier Alexei Kosygin has sent congratulations to you and President Nixon through former Vice President Humphrey who is visiting Russia. The cosmonauts have also issued a statement of congratulations. Humphrey quoted Kosygin as saying "I want you to tell the President and the American people that the Soviet Union desires to work with the United States in the cause of peace."

05 12 17 21 CC
And Mrs. Robert Goddard said today that her husband would have been so happy. "He wouldn't have shouted or anything. He would just have glowed." She added, "That was his dream, sending a rocket to the Moon." People around the world had many reasons to be happy about the Apollo 11 mission. The Italian police reported that Sunday night was the most crime free night of the year. And in London, a boy who had the faith to bet $5 with a bookie that a man would reach the Moon before 1970 collected $24.000. That's pretty good odds.

05 12 18 00 CC
You're probably interested in the comments your wives have made. Neil, Jan had said about yesterday's activities, "The evening was unbelievably perfect. It is an honor and a privilege to share with my husband, the crew, the Manned Spacecraft Center, the American public, and all mankind; the magnificent experience of the beginning of lunar exploration." She was then asked if she considered the Moon landing the greatest moment in her life. She said "No, that was the day we were married." And Mike, Pat said simply, "It was fantastically marvelous." Buzz, Joan said - apparently couldn't quite believe the EVA on the Moon. She said, "It was hard to think it was real until the men actually moved. After the Moon touchdown, I wept because I was so happy." But she added, "The best part of the mission will be the splashdown."

05 12 18 52 CC
In other news, and there was a little bit, another explorer: Thor Heyerdahl had to give up his attempt to sail a papyrus boat across the Atlantic. The storm damaged boat was abandoned about 650 miles from Bermuda. The speed of the craft had been reduced to about 25 miles a day, and Heyerdahl said the object of the voyage had not been to provide an endurance test for the crew.

05 12 19 21 CC
Looking at the world of sports, let's see here. While you were busy the other day, Joe Namath and football Commissioner Pete Rozelle made the announcement that "Broadway Joe" had agreed to sell his interest in the Bachelors III restaurant and report to the New York Jets. Joe arrived at the Jets' training camp today and had his first workout. Several other Jet players who had held out along with Joe also reported. And Davy Hill, from Jackson, Michigan, won his third major golf in as many starts in the past week. He won the Philadelphia Classic. Hill has won four tournaments so far this year and is the leading money winner this year with a cool $129.000. And in baseball, the west division of the National League remains a tight race. LA and San Francisco are one game behind league leading Atlanta. The Astros have a record of 48 wins and 48 losses, and are now in fifth place, seven games out. A twin bill between the Astros and Cincinnati last night was postponed because of rain. The Chicago Cubs



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 85/3 Page 500

are still in first place in the East Division. They lead the New York Mets by four and one half games. And in the American League, Baltimore is breezing toward the Eastern Division title. They lead second place Boston by 11 games. Looking ahead, the All Star baseball game is scheduled for tomorrow. And President Nixon was scheduled to see the game and then leave immediately after the game for the Pacific splashdown area before going on his tour of Europe. And that about covers the news this day. You guys have been making most of it and I'm sure we couldn't fill you in on any of the details that you don't already know. Out.

Yes. The transients were more noticeable than on the previous burns, Charlie. I just wrote it off on the fact we had a light command module, but there was considerable roll activity which dampened down after the first 20 seconds, I would guess, of the burn; but then there was also some pitch and yaw activity. I don't believe it was abnormal, and it seemed to be deadbanding ratherly crisply in roll plus or minus about 8 degrees either side of the center line; and after the

first couple of - oh, after the first 20 seconds or so, the gimbals were quiet, and pitch and yaw were relatively quiet. Before that, there was some oscillation but mostly just in rates. Total attitude hung in there pretty well.

Roger, 11. This is the regional CAP COMM. Congratulations on an outstanding job. You guys have really put on a great show up there. I think it's about time you powered down and got a little rest, however. You've had a mighty long day here. Hope you're all going to get a good sleep on the way back. I look forward to seeing you when you get back here. Don't fraternize with any of those bugs in route except for the Hornet.

Roger. From the hot wires of the Public Affairs Office: Apollo 11 still dominates the news around the world. Only four nations, Communist China, North Korea, North Viet Nam, and Albania, have not yet informed their citizens of your flight and landing on the Moon. One newsman said that he has run out of ways to describe your success. Tonight, President Nixon is scheduled to watch the All Star baseball game in Washington. After the game, he will depart for the Pacific recovery area. Wednesday evening, he will fly from Johnston Island by helicopter to the Navy communications ship Arlington. Then on Thursday morning, he will reboard the helicopter and fly to the Hornet in time to witness your splashdown. Accompanying the President will be Secretary of State William Rogers and Frank Borman. They will watch the splashdown from the bridge of the recovery ship with Admiral John Sidney McCain, Jr., Commander of the Pacific Forces. Following the President's stay aboard the Hornet, he will depart for his tour of Asia and scheduled visit to Romania. Luna 15 is believed to have crashed into the Sea of Crises yesterday after orbiting the Moon 52 times. The Soviet News Agency TASS reported that "scientific"



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 95/4 Page 524

"research in near Moon space was carried out." Sir Bernard Lovell at Jodrell Bank Observatory said that Luna 15 hit the surface of the Moon at a speed of about 300 miles per hour. Things have been relatively quiet recently in Viet Nam. GI's on patrol were observed carrying transistor radios tuned into your flight. The Armed Forces radio and TV network in Viet Nam gave the mission full coverage. Skirmishes still continue between the Egyptians and Israelis along the Suez Canal. U.N. observers there are trying to halt the action. In Washington, the House Ways and Means Committee has voted to reduce the 27.5 percent oil depletion allowance to 20 percent. We've had rain several times here in the Houston area. Today it is cloudy, and more showers are expected. On the sports front, as we mentioned earlier, the All Star game is tonight. There were no games played yesterday. Last night in New York, the Baseball Writers Association of America named Babe Ruth the greatest ball player of all time. Joe DiMaggio was named the greatest living ball player. Frank Borman made the announcements at a dinner honoring the players. Joe Namath put in a full day at the New York Jets' training camp. Five policemen had a hard time restraining about 500 kids who wanted to touch Broadway Joe. He said he feels fine and will play in the All Star game August 1, if Coach Weeb Eubank lets him. The Oilers' camp at Kerrville got wet yesterday, but the workouts continued. There have been some minor injuries, but nothing too serious. Coach Wally Lemm is satisfied so far with the workouts. The Oilers are expecting attendance by over 30.000 for the preseason game with Buffalo. Apparently, Don Meredith's announced retirement isn't expected to dampen enthusiasm, especially around here in Houston. Mario Andretti won the 200 mile Trenton Auto Race Sunday and is now the leading race driver in the U.S. Auto Club's point standings. And that's about the summary of the morning news this afternoon in Houston. Over.

Roger. With respect to the Dow Jones industrials, since closing on Tuesday afternoon the 15th up to about 1:05 p.m. Houston time this afternoon, why, the effect has been a net drop; that is, minus 6 points on the industrial average. So far today since opening, the Dow Jones industrial average has gone down by 11.05 after rising 1 1/2 shortly after opening. Today's performance on the utilities is a drop of 1.63, and railroads a drop of 1.58. Over.

Apollo 11, this is Houston. If you have a minute or so free, I wonder if we could get Mike to give us a little bit of clarification on what happened around about the time of docking. We copied him as mentioning that contact was very smooth, almost imperceptible; and we're a little bit inquisitive or curious about his remarks as to what happened after probe retraction. Over.

06 04 46 00 CMP
Roger. I docked in CMC AUTO, and as I said, I wasn't really sure of the moment of contact. I kept cross checking the docking probe indicators. I got two barber poles indicating that the three capture latches - not capture latches, but the three ... latches had made, and we were soft



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 96/2 Page 527

docked. And at that time the situation looked very stable. So, I went to CMC FREE, glanced back out the window and it still looked stable; and I fired primary 2 bottle. And at that time, a gyration began between the two vehicles due I'm not sure to what. Perhaps the LM thrusting or perhaps it was building up prior, and I hadn't noticed it. But anyway, during the RETRACT of the probe, there were yaw - my yaw excursions of, I would guess, around 15 degrees, and I had to come back on, take the FREE switch and throw it back to AUTO, and try to damp them out; and I guess Neil was doing the same in the LM. I'll let him tell you about his side of it. And I though that we were not going to get a successful RETRACT and hard dock. However, in about - oh, I guess 6 or 8 seconds, I did hear - could see the situation damping out, and then we heard the noise indicating the docking latches had fired; and later on when I got into the tunnel, all 12 of them had properly engaged.

06 04 47 44 CC
Roger.

06 04 47 49 CDR
And on the LM side, we were in AGS MIN deadband ATT HOLD; and at contact, I thrusted plus X; and shortly after that we had a sizable attitude oscillation and thruster firing, so we opened up the deadband to MAX and manually flew the vehicle into stable attitude during the retraction. It went to OFF after ...

Roger. If Neil has a free minute, we've got a question or two regarding the CO2 partial pressure and water in the suit loop discrepancies noted yesterday. Over.

06 05 03 33 CDR
Go ahead.

06 05 03 36 CC
Roger, 11. Was water noted in both suits or only in yours, Neil?

06 05 03 44 CDR
I think only in my suit.

06 05 03 48 CC
Okay. Can you locate that occurrence for us in time when you first noticed water in the suit, either by mission time or relation to any particular event?

06 05 04 17 CDR
I think it was after insertion sometime, Bruce. I don't remember exactly when. I - It was when we were in orbit and had our - after we took our helmets off.

06 05 04 31 CC
Roger. Did you call it to us when you first noticed it, or was it sometime after when you called it?

06 05 04 38 CDR
I'd guess it might have been probably 20 minutes after I noticed it that I mentioned it to you.

06 05 04 44 CC
Roger. Was this noticing the water accompanied by erratic CO2 partial pressure readings, or was that a separate problem? Over.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 96/4 Page 529

06 05 04 57 CDR
Well, the water problem evidenced itself before we noted any erratic motions of the PC02 gage.

06 05 05 06 CC
Roger. And what was the relative sequence on selecting water separator number 2 and the secondary CO2 canister; that is, did you go to the secondary water separator first and then the secondary CO2? Over.

06 05 05 27 LMP
I believe we went to secondary CO2 first.

06 05 05 33 CDR
Secondary hydroxide - lithium hydroxide.

06 05 05 37 CC
Roger. We copy. And was there any change in your suit loop - -

06 05 05 40 CDR
No.

06 05 05 41 CC
Go ahead.

06 05 05 44 LMP
I should mention, Bruce, that when I went to water secondary - water separator to secondary there, I didn't notice any change. But about after 15 minutes or 20 minutes, the water stopped coming out. So maybe that was just water that was already in the loop that was still blowing out, but the secondary water separator was operating properly.

06 05 06 11 CC
Roger. Did you make any changes in the suit loop configuration after you went from the egress mode to the cabin mode after insertion; that is, in particular, they're interested in knowing if you recall changing the diverter valve position to EGRESS at any time while you were on the secondary canister? Over.

06 05 06 36 CMP
No. I don't believe we did that at all, Bruce.

06 05 06 40 CC
Okay, 11. Thank you. That sums up our questions for now, and we'll crank these back into the engineering pipeline and see what we can come up with.

06 05 06 51 LMP
Okay. Are you satisfied that the CO2 circuit breaker was in on jettison? Over.

06 05 07 00 CC
Say again, please?



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 96/5 Page 530

06 05 07 04 LMP
Roger. On LM jettison, are you satisfied that the CO2 circuit breaker was in? Over.

06 05 07 10 CC
Yes. It was in.

06 05 07 17 LMP
Roger. Could you confirm that? I thought there was some question after we got into the command module as to whether that had been left in or not. Over.

06 05 07 34 CC
Roger, 11. It was in and confirmed in, and the readings after jettison stayed about 0.1 to 0.2.

06 05 24 24 CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We have not noticed any change in the signal coming through on the LMP's EKG. When he has a little free time, we'd like him to check into it again. Over.

06 05 24 41 LMP
Roger. I looked at all three of the upper chest center ones, and they appear to be fairly tight. I'll push them back in again. Over.

06 05 24 53 CC
Roger. On the TM here, we noticed some fluctuations that may have been attributed to your moving the sensors around or pushing on them, but the erratic problem seems to be persisting.

06 05 44 27 LMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.

06 05 44 40 CC
11, this is Houston. Over.

06 05 44 45 LMP
Roger. I wonder if you've noticed any change in the BIOMED returns you're getting. Over.

06 05 44 54 CC
Negative, Buzz. It still looks kind of bad. Apparently, when you move around, it's cutting in and out. Have you checked the little electrical connector where it goes into the signal conditioner? Over.

06 05 45 07 LMP
Yes. They're all about as tight as can be. I tell you what; I'll take them off and put them back on again and see if that makes any difference.

06 05 45 17 CC
Okay. If you would, at your convience, we'll be watching it down here.

(GOSS NET 1) Tape 97/3 Page 533

06 07 25 50 CDR
Houston, Apollo 11. I think the reason is in having 1620 on the DSKY during the subsequent entries, or at least that's one possibility.

Go ahead, Houston.

06 07 33 59 CC
Roger. For 64 thousand dollars, we're still trying to work out the location of your landing site, Tranquility Base. We think it is located on LAM 2 chart at Juliet 0.5 and 7.8. Do you still have those charts on board? Over.

06 07 34 24 CDR
Yes. Stand by one. They're packed.

06 07 34 31 CC
Roger. You may not have to unpack it. The position which I just gave you is slightly west of West Crater. I guess it's about two tenths of a kilometer west of it, and we were wondering if Neil or Buzz had observed any additional landmarks during descent, lunar stay, or ascent which would confirm or disprove this. One thing that we're wondering about is that if you were at this position, you would have seen the Cat's Paw during ascent just up to the north of your track. Over.

06 07 35 18 CDR
We were looking for the Cat's Paw, too, thinking we were probably downrange, beyond the Big V. But I think that it's likely that that might have been West Crater that we went across in landing, but - Stand by.

06 07 36 22 CDR
We're hoping, Bruce, that our 16 mm film was working at that point in descent, and we'll be able to confirm our touchdown position. We thought that during ascent we might be able to pick up some recognizable objects close to the landing site, and we did see a number of small craters, and crater rows, and things like that, which we may be able to pick out after the fact, but we haven't been able to yet.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 97/4 Page 534

06 07 36 58 CC
Roger. And the next question from our panel is for Buzz. We recall that he reported seeing a laser upon AOS of the Earth the first time after - the first REV after ascent, and we're wondering what color the beam was and if he could determine at the approximate location with respect to the Earth. Over.

06 07 37 25 LMP
It was mostly white, perhaps a tinge of yellowish color to it; and it seemed to be - as I recall it, the terminator of the Earth was toward the horizon and seemed to be about a quarter to a third of the way down from - down towards the terminator of the Earth - from the opposite horizon. That's a third to a quarter Earth radii. Over.

06 07 38 10 CC
Roger. And that puts it in the light side? Over.

06 07 38 18 LMP
Roger. Yes, it was in the light side. The Earth was about - a two thirds lit Earth, with the terminator down toward the horizon. And now coming from the opposite limb of the Earth, the sunlight limb, coming down about one quarter to one third of a radius in from the limb. Generally, pensively located with respect to a line drawn perpendicular to the terminator that goes through the center. Over.

06 07 38 58 CC
Roger, Buzz. We copy.

06 07 39 02 LMP
And I got pictures of that. I'm sure that will show up.

06 07 39 07 CDR
And I saw that, too. It was a very bright spot of light and I confirm Buzz's observation of its position.

06 07 39 15 CC
Okay, 11. Very good. Now, with respect to the documented sample container: on television it appeared to us as though the samples for that container were in fact being given - being selected in accordance with some thought or consideration being given to the rocks themselves. And we were wondering if you could give any further details from memory about any of these samples, and the context of the material or the surface from which they were taken. Over.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 97/5 Page 535

06 07 39 56 CDR
Yes. You remember I initially started on the cut side of the LM that the TV camera was on, and I took a number of samples of rocks on the surface, and several that were just subsurface - about 20 - 15 to 20 feet north of the LM. And then I recalled that that area had been probably swept pretty well by the exhaust of the descent engine, so I crossed over to the southern side of the LM, and took a number of samples from the area around the elongate double crater that we commented on, and several beyond that, and tried to take as many different types - of rock types as I could see by eye - as I could in the short time we had available. There were a number of other samples that I had seen earlier in our stroll around the LM that I had hoped to get back and pick up and put in the documented sample, but I didn't get those, and I'll be able to comment in detail when we get in the debriefing session.

06 07 41 17 CC
Roger. Did you observe any small craters with conspicuously blocky rims? Over.

06 07 41 28 CDR
Well, aside from the one big one that we went over, I guess there were none in our area. I took a stroll back after putting up the EASEP, and while Buzz was starting to unpack the documented samples - took a stroll back to a crater behind us that was maybe 70 or 80 feet in diameter and 15 or 20 feet deep, and took some pictures of it. It had rocks in the bottom of pretty good size, considerably bigger than any that were out on the surface, but there was no - we apparently, at 15 feet or so, had not gotten below the regolith. We were essentially showing no bedrock, at least in the walls of the crater at that depth. Over.

06 07 42 28 CC
Roger. We copy,

06 07 42 50 CC
Okay. Thank you, Neil. That about wraps up the questions we have on hand for now.

06 07 43 00 CDR
Okay.

06 07 43 50 CDR
My compliments to the chef. The food is outstanding. This cream of chicken soup I give at least three spoons.

06 07 46 29 CC
11, we concur that having VERB 16, NOUN 20 up on the DSKY may well have had some effect on your PTC initiation. It looks like this would give - let the computer work with a knowledge of the actual CDU angles. What we'd like you to do is do a CDU zero which is VERB 40, NOUN 20, ENTER, and then start the PTC procedure again at step 2 with loading VERB 6, NOUN 22, desired attitude in the AUTO maneuver, and all that. Over.

06 07 47 08 CMP
Okay. The only thing I don't understand about that is why it took off at the rate it did. What rate should it have taken off at under that theory?

06 07 52 27 CC
Mike, over here on page 9 7 of your checklist where we're setting up PTC, there's been a note penciled in after, "Wait 20 minutes for rate to damp. Do not monitor VERB 16, NOUN 20." It turns out that the significance of that is that, if you are monitoring 16 NOUN 20, then when you get down here in step 7, the second time you do a VERB 24, you've got to reload the NOUN 01 to make it VERB 24, NOUN 01, ENTER, before you load the three registers. Over.

06 07 53 09 CMP
Roger, that. I was just questioning the rate at which the maneuver would begin if that were not done.

Okay. We're - we're in no rush. This is a very pleasant attitude, as a matter of fact. The Sun is down in the LEB, so it's not shining through the windows and heating the place up.

We know there's a lot of scientists from a number of countries standing by to see the lunar samples, and we thought you'd be interested to see them as they really are here. These two boxes are the sample return containers. They - They're vacuum packed containers that were closed in a vacuum on the lunar surface, sealed, and then brought inside the LM and put inside these fiber glass bags, zippered, and resealed around the outside, and placed in these receptacles in the side of the command module. These are the two boxes. And as soon as we get onto the ship,



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 100/3 Page 545

I'm sure these boxes will immediately be transferred and delivery started to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. These boxes include the samples of the various types of rock, the groundmass of the soil, the sand and silt, and the particle collector for the solar wind experiment, and the core tubes that took depth samples of the lunar surface.

Okay. These bite sized objects were designed to remove the problem of having so many crumbs floating around in the cabin, so they designed a particular size that would be able to go to the mouth all at once. I think since all of our experience, we've discovered that we could progress a good bit further than that back some of the type meals that we have on Earth. As a matter of fact, on this flight we've carried along pieces of bread, and along with the bread we have a ham spread; and I'll show you, I hope, how easy it is to spread some ham while I'm in zero g.

You can also use zero gravity to demonstrate many things that we've all learned in school. I'd like to demonstrate briefly how easy it is to explain the action of the gyroscope. If I spin this can, we know that according to the equations of motion that we would expect that once this is given a spin, and has a spin axis in this direction, if we give it a particular torque, and I'll do this by pushing my hands against it in this fashion once it's spinning. By the equations we can predict that, as I put this torque on it, it will in fact rotate this direction. Let's see how well this works out.

*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases.

Too close, I think.

11, Houston. It's a pretty good demonstration.

06 11 48 46 CMP
Houston, this next is a little demonstration for the kids at home, all kids everywhere, for that matter. I was going to show you how you drink water out of a spoon, but I'm afraid I filled the spoon too full and if I'm not careful, I'm going to spill water right over the sides. Can you see the water slopping around on the top of the spoon, kids?

06 11 49 07 CC
That's affirmative, 11.

06 11 49 12 CMP
Okay. Well, as I said, I was going to show you but I'm afraid I filled it too full and it's going to spill over the sides. I'll tell you what. I'll just turn this one over and get rid of the water and start all over again. Okay?

06 11 49 27 CC
Okay.

06 11 49 35 CMP
And you can see, up here we don't know where over is. One up is as good as another. That really is water, though. I'll show you.

06 11 50 04 CMP
That's really not the way we drink. We really have a water gun which I'll show you.

06 11 50 15 CMP
Here's the water gun. This cylindrical thing on the end of it is a filter with several membranes: one allows water to pass, but not any gas; the other allows gas to pass, but not any water. So, by routing the gaseous water which comes from our tank through this filter, we're enabled to drink purified water without the gas in it, filtered water. And, of course, all we do to - to get it started is just pull the trigger.

06 11 50 58 CMP
It's sort of messy. I haven't been at this very long. It's sort of the same system that the Spaniards used to drink out of wineskins at bull fights, only I think this is even more fun. Well, be seeing you, kids.

Apollo 11, Houston. We were curious to see if there was any excess moisture up around the tunnel hatch area as we saw on 10. Over.

06 11 57 39 CMP
It just so happens that's what we were talking about now. There is a little bit of dampness around the outside edge of the hatch, but a very, very slight amount. We've got a hose up there that we're hoping will sort of help keep it a little bit dry.

In addition, there's about 5 pounds of miscellaneous weight from the LM

That's an old favorite of mine, about - It's an album made about 20 years ago, called "Music Out of the Moon."

Apollo 11, Houston. I was just reading some of the transcripts of earlier today about this earlier PTC that we attempted, and when you keyed into VERB 24 and did the two ENTER's, it took off on you. I think we got a story on that, if you'd like to listen to why it had such a high rate, Mike. Over.

06 14 21 06 CMP
Yes. I'm all ears.

06 14 21 08 CC
Okay. I think it would be better if you got your checklist out on 97, and we could walk you through it, and that way I could probably get the story straight. Over.

06 14 21 21 CMP
Okay. I got it.

06 14 21 22 CC
Okay. Mike, what happened is - you know, you were sitting there monitoring VERB 16, NOUN 20, and at step 7 you went into VERB 24, NOUN 01, and keyed in the address and then INFORMATION INFORMATION; and on the final ENTER of that 35400 ENTER, right after that, it - that then put you back into the 16, NOUN 20. Then when you did the VERB 24, ENTER, you were really entering the information in the actual CDU; and when you got the two entries in, in register 1 and 2, it was an - it was an instantaneous change in the actual CDU, and the CM DAP looked at that and saw - saw what it thought it

had. My - my gosh, I got a 600 degree per second rate. And it turns on the jets to try to take that rate out. And the rate filters that it's looking at - it - well, the rate it's looking at is filtered, so it doesn't really sense the actual rate until the thing is already built up, and then it starts reading the rate filters, and it says, "Well, I really didn't have 600 degrees." So then it turns it off and tries to slow it down. But until that happens, and it is some time lag, and that's why the rate was building up. The jets were on, and they were going to stay on due to that instantaneous 600 - suspected 600 degree per second rate. Over.

Hey, Charlie, are you saying that for a short period of time, he actually loaded NOUN 20 with some value other than was being read by the CDU?

06 14 23 34 CC
I think I got that, Buzz. That's affirmative. But when he did that second VERB 24, you were - the NOUN was 20, so when he did the 3175 and then a 002 ENTER, what he actually did there was load the first two actual CDU locations, and the computer looked at it - the DAP looked at it as an instantaneous change in the actual CDU. Stand by on your comments. We're switching antennas.

11, Houston. We got you back now on the high gain. Did you copy all that, Buzz? Over.

06 14 24 51 LMP
Yes. I think so. I - I thought maybe that NOUN 20 was one of those that you could never load from the DSKY, and that still maybe. Maybe it was loaded just for the short period of time, and then when the counters read the - the gimbal angles, why they changed it back to what they actually are. But in the meantime, the DAP saw this different number. Is that right?

I doubt if it will fit on the helmet in B1. The other one might - might go in the sleep restraint. We've got them in our helmet bags, and I guess we're going to have to keep the helmets in the helmet bags, and the LEVVA's in the LEVVA bags.

to do it on our marks from the ground. The PTC is a little bit ragged, and we would like to make the water dump at a time which we think will hold it in its proper configuration, so it looks like we'll have a desirable opportunity coming along in - between 15 and 20 minutes.

11, Houston. Present forecast shows acceptable conditions in your recovery area: 2000 foot scattered, high scattered, wind from 070 degrees, 13 knots, visibility 10 miles, and sea state about 4 feet. The forecast yesterday showed a tropical storm, Claudia, some 500 to 1000 miles east of Hawaii. The - the pictures from Earth satellites taken yesterday afternoon - afternoon showed Claudia dissipating, so this appears to be even less a factor than it was before. Your recovery area is now believed to be just a little ways north of the intertropical convergence zone, which you can probably see when you look out your windows there. Yesterday there was also a report of a tropical storm, Viola, further to the west. Its present location is some thousand miles east of the Phillipines and moving northwest. Tropical storm Viola has been intensifying, and should be transferred to the typhoon category within the next 12 hours or so; however, that will be far to your west. As a matter of fact, sunrise terminator has not yet reached Viola. When it does several hours from now, you can probably distinguish it from your viewpoint quite readily. As a matter of fact it should be of interest to perhaps take some pictures. Comment on it when you get a chance to see Viola in a few hours. So that's about the present weather state and situation for your recovery area. Over.

Yes. It came in quite quickly. However, I'm showing about 240 yaw and about zero on pitch, now.

07 04 23 22 CC
Roger. About 240 and 0.

Apollo 11, Houston. Over.

07 05 35 28 CDR
Go ahead.

07 05 35 29 CC
Roger. Just wanted to make sure you fellows hadn't gone back to sleep again. And I also have a little bit of late news here if you'd like to find out what's happened in the last 12 - 14 hours. Over.

07 05 35 42 CDR
Okay. Go ahead.

07 05 35 44 CC
Okey doke. Hot off the press here: We find Juan Carlos was formally designated yesterday - Tuesday - to become General Franco's successor - as the Chief of State of Spain and eventual King. Juan Carlos will be sworn in today as his successor designate after taking an oath of loyalty to the law and the National Movement, Spain's only legal political organization. He will apparently be called the Prince of Spain.

07 05 36 14 CC
House Ways and Means Committee also has agreed yesterday to tax changes affecting oil companies, also banks and utilities, which could add as much as 2 billion dollars per year to the federal revenue. The committee also voted tentatively to change the accounting procedures for telephone, electric, gas, and oil pipeline companies and to reduce tax benefits of mutual savings and loan institutions. So, it looks as if tax reform may be on the way.

07 05 36 42 CC
Looking overseas, we find South Korea's first super highway, linking Seoul with the Port of Inchon, has been named the Apollo Highway to commemorate your trip. I think we mentioned last night that President Nixon has already started on his round the world trip, and today he is in San Francisco on his first stop which will take him to the U.S.S. Hornet, from which he'll watch the return of your spacecraft. He plans to visit seven nations including Rumania during this trip. He, as I think you also knew, had to miss the All Star baseball game yesterday, as it was rained out; but it is being played today.

The West Coast residents in Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Vancouver, British Columbia; and San Francisco all plan to make their areas visible to the three of you by lighting their lights between 9 pm and midnight tonight, according to the Associated Press. We do have clear weather predicted there, so you may be able to see Christmas lights, porch lights, store lights, and whatever may be turned on.

07 05 37 38 CDR
Good show.

07 05 37 39 CC
A little closer to home here, back in Memphis, Tennessee, a young lady who is presently tipping the scales at 8 pounds, 2 ounces, was named "Module" by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Eddie Lee McGhee. "It wasn't my idea." said Mrs. McGhee, "It was my husband's." She said she had balked at the name Lunar Module McGhee, because it didn't sound too good, but apparently they have compromised on just Module. Over.

07 05 38 29 SC
(Laughter) ...

07 05 38 32 CC
Roger. Hear a few chuckles coming from that direction. And we do have a late report on the sports here also. The All Star game currently being played. The present score at the end of the fourth inning has the National League leading the American League by 9 to 3. So the hitters are having a good day, you can tell.

07 05 38 54 CC
And rain clouds are over the MSC area at the moment. It began raining here just about 10 minutes ago, and last report, we were having a pretty heavy deluge. So, that's it from the news front for the afternoon here, Apollo 11. Over.

07 05 39 19 CDR
Thank you very much, Owen. I think my yard could use some water.

07 05 39 23 CC
That's very true. I've forgotten exactly how many days it did go, Buzz, but something like 30 days without rain; and we can aprreciate the rain we're getting right now.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 112/3 Page 578

07 05 39 34 LMP
That was Neil. This is Buzz, here. I wish we could find out when the last time my lawn was cut. Over.

07 05 39 39 CMP
That might be a little more difficult to find out. I'm not sure whether the - whether Mike is ready to admit when he last did the job, but I'll look into that for you.

07 05 39 51 LMP
Well, he'll tell you. He's got a new mower.

07 05 39 53 CC
Roger.

07 05 40 04 CMP
Hey, ask my chinch bugs how they're toing?

07 05 40 07 CC
Well, I'm not sure about your's. I can let you know about my own, and the report isn't very good.

07 05 47 45 CC
11, Houston. Over.

07 05 47 50 LMP
Go ahead.

07 05 47 51 CC
Roger. Joan wasn't home right now, Buzz, but Janis reports the grass is getting pretty high, and I would estimate that it's going to be close to your knees by the time you get out of quarantine. Over.

07 05 48 08 LMP
Okay. I'll have to schedule a little discussion after I get back.

07 05 48 13 CC
Roger. And no reports - no report from the chinch bugs there, Mike.

07 05 48 21 CMP
Well, they're sort of taciturn little fellows. They don't say much; they just chomp away.

07 05 48 26 CC
Concur on that.

07 05 48 47 CMP
Which is about what we're doing up here.

07 05 48 52 CC
We concur on that, too.

07 05 49 18 CMP
Breakfast was magnificent as usual. I had sliced peaches, sausage patties, two cups of coffee, and I forget all what else.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 112/4 Page 579

07 05 49 27 CC
That does sound pretty good. As a matter of fact, I'm way overdue for a meal myself, here. I could use some of that.

07 05 49 50 CMP
Why don't you get Milt to give you 5 minutes off and grab a hamburger?

07 05 50 00 CC
I suggested that awhile ago. He was pointing out about the weight problem here. We've got to keep the calories low, so I'd better stand by without it.

07 05 52 46 CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. We've been doing a little flight planning for Apollo 12 up here.

07 05 52 54 CC
Roger. Go ahead.

07 05 52 57 CMP
We're trying to calculate how much spagetti and meatballs we can get on board for Al Bean.

07 05 53 05 CC
I'm not sure the spacecraft will take that much extra weight. Have you made any estimates?

07 05 53 12 CMP
It'll be close.

07 05 55 52 CC
11, Houston. The medics at the next console report that the shrew is one animal which can eat six times its own body weight every 24 hours. This may be a satisfactory base line for your spaghetti calculations on Al Bean. Over.

07 05 56 11 CMP
Okay. Thank you. That's in work.

07 05 59 15 CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. It was slightly colder in here last night than it has been on any previous night. Does EECOMM notice any change in his data or any explanation for that?

07 05 59 25 CC
Roger. Stand by just a moment. We've got to check some temperatures.

07 05 59 35 CMP
Up until last night it was - if anything, a little on the warm side at night. Last night it was on the chilly side.

07 05 59 43 CC
Roger there. We'll run down the temperatures for the 2 nights.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 112/5 Page 580

07 05 59 50 CMP
Oh, it's no big thing. Just as a matter of interest.

07 05 59 52 CC
Roger.

07 06 00 05 CMP
And how'd you like the command module RCS temperatures?

07 06 00 17 CC
11, Houston. They all look very good. The lowest temperature was 40 degrees, and we're taking a look at your cabin temperatures now.

07 06 00 27 CMP
We agree on the CM RCS. No heaters are going 2 to be required by a country mile.

07 06 00 38 CC
We think that's correct.

07 06 00 50 CMP
We don't like those heaters, anyway, working off the direct coils.

07 06 00 53 CC
Roger.

07 06 01 34 CMP
Peculiar thing, Owen, on the platform alignment is that when I really take my time and do a very slow, careful, precise job of marking. I'm getting about the same star angle difference as when I'm doing it in DTC and have to do a hurried rush job with relatively poor tracking. Star angle differences seem insensitive. It almost made me believe there's a very small bias there somewhere in the sextant.

07 06 02 07 CC
Roger, 11. Perhaps the 3 degrees per second just isn't that much of a bother. Over.

07 06 02 16 LMP
Well, he's really trying to explain why he can't get all zeros.

07 06 02 20 CMP
I think Buzz is probably right. As a matter of fact, one time I made a mark which I thought was a little bit in error, but I tho thought, "Well heck. I'll go ahead and see how it works out anyway," and I got five zeros that time. And when I have thought everything was exactly precisely on, I have consistently been getting 0.01.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 112/6 Page 581

07 06 02 52 CC
Roger. Apparently it pays to hurry.

07 06 02 59 CMP
I usually do.

07 06 03 07 CMP
The visibility through the telescope has been very poor. It's, I would say, even worse than the simulator is right now. It requires long periods of dark adaptation which most times are most inconvenient; so it's really a tremendous asset to keep the platform powered up at all times and to keep it tweaked within the capability of the sextant field of view.

07 06 03 37 CC
Understand, Mike.

07 06 05 07 CC
11, Houston. Checking your temperatures, it does look like the spacecraft may have cooled down perhaps 2 or 3 degrees in the last 24 hours, and that sounds to be consistent with your report on the comfort level there. Over.

07 06 05 25 CMP
Okay.

07 06 05 29 CDR
Is that a LM off phenomenon?

07 06 05 59 CC
11, Houston. It looks like we'll have to think a little more about that, as to whether it's a LM off or some effect of being out of Lunar orbit. We don't know, so we'll have to puzzle before we can give a better answer.

07 06 06 12 CDR
Okay.

07 06 06 15 CMP
Well, if the systems guys have anything they want chased down, we'll be happy to give you any readings or reports or what have you.

07 06 06 23 CC
Roger. We'll think about that and see if there aren't some other tests to be usefully performed here.

07 06 06 31 CMP
Okay.

07 06 13 09 CC
11, Houston. I'll be turning things over to the Green CAP COMM at this time, and see you on the ground tomorrow.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 112/7 Page 582

07 06 13 25 CDR
Okay, Owen. I want to thank you and the whole Purple/Maroon group there for a good job helping Apollo 11.

07 06 13 35 CC
Thank you, sir.

07 06 13 41 LMP
Thanks from us to all of you. It was really appreciated.

07 06 13 45 CMP
Great job, you guys.

07 06 13 50 CC
Roger, out.

07 06 26 30 CC
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.

07 06 26 34 CMP
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.

07 06 26 37 CC
11, this is Houston. With reference to your subjective evaluation that it felt cooler in side the spacecraft last night, we reported earlier that we did indeed see a drop of about 3 degrees over the previous night. Looking back, it appears the crew of Apollo 10 reported similar feelings during the translunar and transearth coast phases. We're wondering if you could give us any indication of the relative amounts of free or condensed water in the cabin last night and the night before from which we could infer humidity. Over.

07 06 27 27 CDR
Roger. That might be a little bit difficult to do. We'll take a look at the tunnel now. It does seem as though, between the dirt, we had a little bit more moisture in the tunnel. Of course, the LM hadn't been vented when we did translunar.

07 06 27 45 CC
Roger. We were more curious about the relative amount of moisture between, say, last night and the night before, both of which would have the LM missing.

07 06 28 04 CMP
There's more moisture in the tunnel now than there has been at any previous time. Subjectively we have been unable to determine any change in - any buildup in humidity. There appears to be no moisture any other place in the spacecraft. For example, the windows are not fogging or - and various other cool spots around the spacecraft - all of them appear to be completely dry.

How are all the "Greens" today, Bruce?

07 06 42 14 CC
Oh, the Greens are in good shape. The actual Green Team has been here for several hours. We're dogging the watch down here to position Ron for entry. Over.

07 06 42 25 CMP
Roger. Understand. Did Dave Reed get to explain the lunar ... at the press conference?

07 06 42 32 CC
No, but your comments about Bill Shaffer and the explanations were quoted in the paper last night.

07 06 42 40 CMP
Oh, oh.

07 06 42 45 CC
Do you want to say anything more while you're on the line?

07 06 42 51 CMP
He's right. He's absolutely right.

07 06 44 05 CMP
How's old White, Bruce? Did he ever let you go get a cup of coffee when we were over on the back side?

07 06 44 15 CC
Oh, things have been going pretty smoothly down here. He's really not that hard to get along with.

07 06 44 21 CMP
Oh, he must be mellowing.

07 06 44 23 CC
We've only got two of them back here right now.

07 06 44 30 CMP
He always used to make me sit at the console through the back side passes, just for training.

07 06 44 41 CC
Well, the word we have here is - that was because whenever you came back, you had to be retrained.

07 06 44 50 CMP
Touché.

07 06 51 08 CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Out of curiosity, on those 70 mm cameras, we figure we exposed around 300 in the LM and around a thousand in the command module; and both cameras - or all the 70 mm cameras worked just fine.

07 06 51 26 CC
Okay. Very good. Thank you.

Okay. On page 6 1 of the entry out checklist down toward the bottom after "MAIN DEPLOY pushbutton," we have three additional steps we'd like you to accomplish. The intent of this is to reduce the oxygen pressure in your manifold and to eliminate the oxygen bleed flow through the potable and waste water tanks during descent. Over.

Okay. We've got 6 1 out. Go ahead.

07 07 09 00 CC
Okay. Down at the bottom, you've got "10,000 feet MAIN PARACHUTE DEPLOY, MAIN DEPLOY pushbutton, PUSH within 1 second." And after that step, we'd like you insert "SURGE TANK O2 valve, OFF; REPRESS PACKAGE valve, OFF; and DIRECT O2 valve, OPEN." Do you copy?

07 09 32 24 CDR
Good evening. This is the Commander of Apollo 11. A hundred years ago, Jules Verne wrote a book about a voyage to the Moon. His spaceship, Columbia, took off from Florida and landed in the Pacific Ocean after completing a trip to the Moon. It seems appropriate to us to share with you some of the reflections of the crew as the modern day Columbia completes its rendezvous with the planet Earth and the same Pacific Ocean tomorrow. First, Mike Collins.

07 09 33 35 CC

We're glad to hear that.

07 09 34 38 CC
Okay, 11. You're back on, with Mike in the middle of the screen there.

07 09 34 44 CMP
Roger. This trip of ours to the Moon may have looked, to you, simple or easy. I'd like to assure you that has not been the case. The Saturn V rocket which put us into orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly. This computer up above my head has a 38,000 word vocabulary, each word of which has been very carefullly chosen to be of the utmost value to us, the crew. This switch which I have in my hand now, has over 300 counterparts in the command module alone, this one single switch design. In addition to that, there are myriads of circuit breakers, levers, rods, and other associated controls. The SPS engine, our large rocket engine on the aft end of our service module, must have performed flawlessly, or we would have been stranded in lunar orbit. The parachutes up above my head must work perfectly tomorrow or we will plummet into the



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 114/3 Page 589

ocean. We have always had confidence that all this equipment will work, and work properly, and we continue to have confidence that it will do so for the remainder of the flight. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of people. First, the American workmen who put these pieces of machinery together in the factory. Second, the painstaking work done by the various test teams during the assembly and retest after assembly. And finally, the people at the Manned Spacecraft Center, both in management, in mission planning, in flight control, and last, but not least, in crew training. This operation is somewhat like the periscope of a submarine. All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all those, I would like to say, thank you very much.

07 09 37 52 CC
11, this is Houston. We're getting a good picture of Buzz now, but no voice modulation. And would you open up the f stop on the TV camera; try 22, please?

07 09 38 13 CC
That appears to be a lot better now. We're still not receiving Buzz's audio.

07 09 38 20 LMP
Good evening. I'd like to discuss with you a few of the more symbolic aspects of the flight of our mission, Apollo 11. As we've been discussing the events that have taken place in the past 2 or 3 days here on board our spacecraft, we've come to the conclusion that this has been far more than three men on a voyage to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown. Neil's statement the other day upon first setting foot on the surface of the Moon, "This is a small step for a man, but a great leap for mankind," I believe sums up these feelings very nicely. We accepted the challenge of going to the Moon; the acceptance of this challenge was inevitable. The relative ease with which we carried out our mission, I believe, is a tribute to the timeliness of that acceptance. Today, I feel we're fully capable of accepting expanded roles in the exploration of space. In retrospect, we have all been particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriously



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 114/4 Page 590

chose for our spacecraft, Columbia and Eagle. We've been particularly pleased with the emblem of our flight, depicting the U.S. eagle bringing the universal symbol of peace from the Earth, from the planet Earth to the Moon; that symbol being the olive branch. It was our overall crew choice to deposit a replica of this symbol on the Moon. Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind to me.

The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have through their will, indicated their desire; next, to four administrations, and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, to the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the space suit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give a special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft, who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their - their hearts and all their abilities into those crafts. To those people, tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.

Houston, Apollo 11. Do you want to crank up PTC again; do you have some reason to hold its attitude, or what's your pleasure?

07 09 47 57 CC
You can crank up PTC again, Mike, any time you like. And I might add I thought that was a mighty fine TV presentation. There's certainly nothing I can add to it from down here.

Okay, 11. I've got a few small items here: one flight plan update and some entry photography information, if you are ready to copy. Over.

Go ahead.

07 09 53 51 CC
Roger. At 180 hours 50 minutes GET, we should like to delete your oxygen fuel cell purge.

07 09 54 02 CDR
Okay.

07 09 54 03 CC
And on the entry photography, if you are going to use a fresh magazine of color interior film, we recommend the following exposure settings: f11 at 1/250, six frames per second, focus on 7 feet for the fireball; f2.0, 1/60 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 50 feet when the chutes open. If you are using a magazine, part of which has already been used for interior shots, we recommend f16 at 1/500 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 7 feet for the fireball; f2.8, 1/60 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 50 feet when the parachutes open. And we would like to know the magazine number that you are intending to use if you have a chance. Over.

07 09 55 22 CMP
Okay. I think we got those. We will be using a fresh one and it will be color interior. Over.

07 09 55 32 CC
Roger. When you get - get it out, we would like to have the number of the magazine and the letter of the magazine relayed down.

07 09 55 42 CDR
Okay. And we're thinking that we might want to run some of that at 12 frames per second. And I think we can get everything from 0.5 - 0.5g down; that will only give us about 7.8 minutes and ... frames ... double that. I guess maybe just an occasional burst to 12 frames would be what we want and the rest of it at six. Over.

07 09 56 23 CC
This is Houston. That plan sounds fine with us, Neil.

07 09 56 28 CDR
Okay.

07 13 40 16 CMP
Okay.

07 13 41 16 CC
11, Houston. Our recommendation on the gear you got in the helmet bag - correction, hatch bag, would be to remove that stuff and put it in the sleep restraint under the right couch. The reason is that the hatch bag straps are only configured for zero g, and it is a pretty difficult job getting it lashed down. With the gear in the sleep restraint, it's a pretty standard lash down procedure, and you could also use the Beta cord that you have on hoard. You concur? Over.

07 13 42 03 CMP
Yes. We'll look at it, Charlie, and let you know.

07 13 42 06 CC
Roger. And I got a couple of other things, Mike. We need to terminate battery B charge at this time, and also, the weather is clobbering in at our targeted landing point due to scattered thunderstorms. We don't want to tangle with one of those, so we are going to move the - your aim point uprange. Correction, it will be downrange, to target for 1500 nautical mile entry so we can guarantee uplift control. The new coordinates are 13 degrees, 19 minutes north, 169 10 minutes west. The weather in that area is super. We got 2000 scattered, 8000 scattered with 10 miles visibility and 6 foot seas and the Hornet is sitting in great position to get to that targeted positton.

All of them were very touched by your television broadcast. Jan and Pat watched from Mission Control here. The launch of Intelsat from the Cape was postponed for the fourth time last night. The problem was said to be a malfunctioning nitrogen regulator in the second stage of Delta. A new attempt will be made to launch it tonight. The research submarine Ben Franklin, which is studying the Gulf Stream, set a record by drifting 24 hours from 10 to 100 feet above the ocean floor in 1300 feet of water off the Georgia coast. The mission is led by Jacques Picard. Wally Schirra has been elected to a 5 year term on the board of trustees of the Detroit Institute of Technology.

It might be noted that more than 100 have been made by men for their mothers in law. And finally, it appears that rather than killing romantic songs about the Moon, you have inspired hundreds of song writers. Nashville, Tennessee, which probably houses the largest collection of recording companies and song publishers in the country, now reports it is being flooded by Moon songs. Some will make it. The song at the top of the best sellers list this week is, "In the year 2525." Morning Bugle. Out.

Roger, 11. We don't have to worry about it any more. The altimeter out there is now standard, 29.92; but basically what it means is that if I give you a plus 10 feet, for instance, that means that you will hit the water with the ailtimeter reading 10 feet. Over.

11, Houston. You started out right, and then the numbers you read back were correct; but I didn't get your comment in between there.

07 23 52 58 LMP
I assume that - all I wanted to know is that first time, 07 20, that's the time of steam pressure peg. Right?

07 23 53 04 CC
That's affirmative.

07 23 53 06 LMP
Okay.

07 23 58 05 CMP
Houston, Apollo 11. Ron, I'm ready to copy your message about the constant drag level.



(GOSS NET 1) Tape 123/4 Page 613

07 23 58 13 CC
Okay, Mike. Of course, this is in the event the G&N and the EMS quits and you have to fly the constant g; and what we're trying to do is extend the constant g range from 1100 to 1500 miles. We've run this procedure in the simulator, and it works fine. Basically, I'll go through it - just go through it, and then if you have any questions come back. But it's the same lift vector up until MAX g, and then lift vector down, and then modulate the lift vector until g dot goes to zero. Okay. This procedure is essentially the same so far. And then hold g dot zero until you pass the RETRO elapsed time of V circular; and then after you pass this RETRO elapsed time of V circular, roll to a gimbal angle of 45 degrees, and then hold this constant bank angle of 45 degrees until you come to the RETRO elapsed time of drogues. Over.

07 23 59 44 CMP
Okay. It sounds straightforward enough. Understand constant g backup backup procedure, lift vector up until MAX g and then lift vector down; then modulate until bank angle until g dot equals zero. Maintain g dot equals zero until subcircular, then roll 45 degrees and hold until drogue time. Over.

08 00 00 07 CC
Okay. That's mighty fine, Mike. That's correct.
